  {
    question: "Why should a contract be reviewed before signing?",
    answer:
      "Once you sign, you are generally bound by the terms in the document, whether or not you read them carefully. A review before signing gives you the chance to understand the obligations you are taking on and to ask for changes while the other party still has an incentive to agree.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the risk of a personal guarantee?",
    answer:
      "A personal guarantee can make you personally responsible for another party's debts or obligations, which may put your own assets at risk if the business cannot meet them. If a contract includes a guarantee, it is worth understanding the full extent of what you are being asked to guarantee and for how long.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you explain the contract in plain language?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We go through the document and explain what each significant clause means in practice, rather than simply repeating the legal wording. You should be able to make a decision knowing what the terms actually require of you.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you review contracts prepared by the other party?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Many of the contracts we review have been drafted by the other side, often with their interests in mind. We identify the terms that shift risk onto you and suggest amendments or points to negotiate.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I have already signed the contract?",
    answer:
      "It is still worth understanding your position, particularly if a problem has started or a deadline is approaching. Depending on the circumstances, there may be room to negotiate a variation, or to rely on a particular clause. We can explain the options available on the facts.",
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly can a contract be reviewed?",
    answer:
      "It depends on the length and complexity of the document, but standard commercial contracts are often reviewed within a few business days. If you are working to a deadline, let us know when you make contact so the review can be scheduled accordingly.",
  },

              Contracts are often presented with a short timeframe and an expectation of a quick answer.
              In that situation it is easy to focus on the commercial terms — the price and the work —
              and skip over the clauses that decide what happens if things do not go to plan.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              A contract review gives you a clear picture before you are bound. We read the document in
              full, identify the terms that carry real risk, and explain what each one means for your
              business. Where a clause is unbalanced or unclear, we set out what could be changed and how
              to raise it with the other party.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              What matters most in a review depends on the contract, the parties, the value of the deal
              and your individual circumstances. We will tell you where we think the attention should go.

              We review agreements across a broad range of commercial arrangements, including:

            <ul className="points-list" style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }}>
              {contractTypes.map((item) => (

              Some clauses carry more weight than their length suggests. A renewal clause can lock you
              into another term. A restraint clause can limit where you work or who you deal with after
              the arrangement ends. An indemnity can require you to cover losses that have nothing to do
              with your own conduct. We point these out clearly rather than leaving you to work through
              the document alone.

              A review is not only about risk. It is also about understanding what you must do, by when,
              and what the other party owes you in return. That includes delivery dates, standards of
              work, reporting requirements, insurance obligations and who is responsible for approvals.

              We explain the terms so that you can decide whether the arrangement is one you can properly
              perform. If the answer is no, it is better to know before signing than after.
