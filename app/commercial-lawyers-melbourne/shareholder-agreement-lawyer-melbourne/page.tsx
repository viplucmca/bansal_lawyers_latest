    question: "What is a shareholder agreement?",
    answer:
      "A shareholder agreement is a contract between the shareholders of a company that sets out how the company will be governed and how the shareholders will deal with each other. It sits alongside the company's constitution and deals with matters such as decision-making, share transfers, exits and dispute resolution.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do small companies need a shareholder agreement?",
    answer:
      "Small companies often need one most. Where there are only two or three shareholders, disagreements can stall the business completely, and there may be no clear way to break a deadlock. A written agreement sets out how those situations are handled before they arise.",
  },
  {
    question: "When is the right time to put a shareholder agreement in place?",
    answer:
      "The best time is at the start, when the shareholders are working well together and the terms are easy to discuss. Once a disagreement has developed, negotiating governance rules becomes far more difficult and often requires legal steps instead.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can a shareholder agreement cover how shares are valued on exit?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Setting out a valuation method in advance is one of the more useful parts of a shareholder agreement. It reduces the scope for argument when a shareholder leaves, and can avoid the cost of a later valuation dispute.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if shareholders cannot agree on a major decision?",
    answer:
      "Without a deadlock provision, the company can effectively stop. A shareholder agreement can set out a clear process, such as referring the matter to mediation, using a casting vote, or triggering a buy-out mechanism. The right approach depends on the business and the shareholders involved.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help if a shareholder dispute has already started?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can review the existing agreement and company documents, explain your position and the options available, and advise on negotiation or further steps. What is appropriate depends on the terms of the agreement, the conduct of the parties and the outcome you are seeking.",

            <h2>Why Shareholders Need a Written Agreement</h2>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.08rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink)", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
              When a company is set up, the shareholders usually share the same goals. Decisions are made
              informally, and there is little need to write down how the relationship will work. Over
              time, circumstances change: one shareholder wants to sell, another wants to invest further,
              or the business takes a direction the others did not expect.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              A shareholder agreement records the rules while the relationship is strong. It sets out how
              decisions are made, how shares can be transferred, how a shareholder can exit and how
              disagreements are resolved. Those provisions are what keep a company operating when the
              shareholders no longer see things the same way.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              We advise on the company structure, the roles of directors and shareholders, and the
              arrangements that suit the particular business. Every agreement depends on the ownership
              structure, the commercial relationship and the risks the parties are prepared to accept.

            <h2>What a Shareholder Agreement Should Cover</h2>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink)", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
              The terms needed will differ from company to company, but most shareholder agreements
              should address the following:
            </p>
            <ul className="points-list" style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }}>
              {agreementTerms.map((item) => (
                <li key={item}>{item}</li>
              ))}
            </ul>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "1.25rem" }}>
              It is also worth distinguishing between the roles of a director and a shareholder. A
              director has duties under the Corporations Act and responsibilities that cannot simply be
              set aside by agreement, while a shareholder&apos;s rights are largely governed by the
              agreement and the company&apos;s constitution. We explain how the two interact in your
              company.

            <h2>What Can Happen Without a Shareholder Agreement</h2>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink)", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
              Without an agreement, the company&apos;s constitution and the Corporations Act apply. Those
              rules may not reflect what the shareholders actually intended, and they often leave gaps
              where a small company needs clear answers.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              A deadlock between shareholders can bring the business to a standstill. A shareholder who
              wants to leave may have no clear way to sell their shares, and the remaining shareholders
              may be unable to prevent those shares going to an outsider. Where a shareholder dies,
              ownership can pass to their estate and create further complications.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              Where a dispute has already arisen, we can assist with commercial disputes and, where
              appropriate, with notices and negotiations aimed at resolving the matter.
