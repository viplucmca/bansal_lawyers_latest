  {
    question: "What happens at my first court appearance (mention hearing)?",
    answer:
      "A first mention hearing is the administrative starting point in the Magistrates' Court. It is not a trial. Your lawyer will appear on your behalf, confirm receipt of the preliminary brief, and inform the magistrate whether the matter will proceed to a Summary Case Conference, Contest Mention, Diversion hearing, or a Plea of Guilty. In many instances, your lawyer can seek an adjournment to allow sufficient time to review the evidence.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I have to appear in person for every court date?",
    answer:
      "Under Victorian court practice, your lawyer can often appear on your behalf or arrange an online appearance via Webex for administrative mentions, provided you are on bail or summons. However, for contested hearings, committals, and final plea hearings, your physical attendance in court is generally mandatory unless the court grants a specific exemption.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a Summary Case Conference and Contest Mention?",
    answer:
      "A Summary Case Conference is a structured discussion between your defence lawyer and the police prosecutor to explore whether charges can be withdrawn, amended, or resolved on an agreed summary of facts. If the matter cannot be resolved, it proceeds to a Contest Mention, where the magistrate evaluates the issues in dispute and estimates the required hearing time.",
  },
  {
    question: "How should I prepare for attending a criminal court hearing in Melbourne?",
    answer:
      "Dress conservatively in neat business attire, arrive at court at least 30 to 45 minutes prior to the scheduled list time (usually 9:30 am in the Magistrates' Court), and meet your lawyer before entering the courtroom. Switch off your mobile phone, remain quiet while proceedings are underway, and address the magistrate as 'Your Honour'.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can an experienced lawyer help negotiate charges before a trial?",
    answer:
      "Yes. A significant proportion of criminal charges are resolved before trial through skilled negotiation. By pointing out evidentiary gaps, legal defences, or inconsistencies in witness statements during case conferencing, your lawyer can persuade prosecutors to discontinue weak charges or accept a plea to a less serious summary offence.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a plea in mitigation?",
    answer:
      "A plea in mitigation occurs when an accused person enters a plea of guilty, and their lawyer makes structured legal and personal submissions to the court to minimise the sentence. The lawyer presents character references, medical reports, evidence of remorse, and explains the background circumstances to persuade the magistrate or judge to impose the lowest appropriate penalty, such as a fine, diversion, or Community Correction Order without recording a conviction.",

              Navigating Victorian criminal proceedings requires strict adherence to court procedure, evidentiary
              rules, and the Criminal Procedure Act 2009. From the moment you receive a charge sheet and summons,
              the court imposes procedural milestones that determine how and when evidence is tested.

              Entering a courtroom without legal representation places an accused person at a profound
              disadvantage against experienced Victoria Police or Office of Public Prosecutions (OPP) advocates.

              and your voice is heard clearly before the bench.

              Sentencing under the Victorian Sentencing Act 1991 involves complex balancing of competing

              Whether your case requires aggressive contest of weak evidence or careful structuring of a plea
              in mitigation, having experienced counsel who understands local magistrates and prosecutor

              long-term reputation.
