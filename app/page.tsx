  {
    question: "Can I have a consultation online or by phone?",
    answer:
      "Yes. If you can't get to the office, or you're interstate or overseas, you can book a phone or video consultation. Just tell us which you'd prefer when you get in touch.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens during the first consultation?",
    answer:
      "You tell us what's happened, and we go through any documents you have. Then we set out your options, any time limits that apply and what the next steps could be. You'll leave knowing where you stand, and it's up to you whether to go ahead with us.",

  {
    question: "What documents should I bring?",
    answer:
      "It depends on the matter, but bring anything connected to it. That might be letters or notices, visa decision records, court or police paperwork, contracts, agreements or ID. If you're not sure, bring what you have and we'll tell you what else we need.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long will my legal matter take?",
    answer:
      "It varies a lot. A contract review might take a few days, while a court matter, a property settlement or an ART review can take months. Once we've looked at your situation we'll give you a realistic estimate, and we'll tell you if anything changes.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are there deadlines I need to worry about?",
    answer:
      "Often, yes. Time limits can apply to ART reviews, court dates, notices and other legal steps, and some are short. If you've just received a decision or a document, it's worth getting advice straight away.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if my matter involves more than one area of law?",
    answer:
      "That happens a lot. A separation can affect a visa, and a business dispute can involve property. Because our team works across several areas of law, we can look at the whole picture instead of one issue at a time.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I'm not sure which type of lawyer I need?",
    answer:
      "That's fine. Tell us briefly what's happened when you get in touch, and we'll point you to the right person on our team. You don't need to work out the legal category before you call.",
