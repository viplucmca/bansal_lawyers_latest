      "Often, yes, if you own land or other immovable property in India. That property is dealt with under the law of the place where it sits. A will signed only in Melbourne is not always the document an Indian registry, bank or court will act on. A later will made in India can also revoke your Australian will if the revocation clause is too wide. We draft the two wills so each one covers the assets it is meant to cover.",

    question: "Does an Australian power of attorney work in India?",
    answer:
      "Usually, no. An enduring power of attorney made in Victoria appoints someone to make decisions under Victorian law. If a relative needs to sign, sell or manage property in India, the document is generally an Indian power of attorney, prepared for that transaction and completed with the notarisation and India-side steps the receiving office expects.",

The application is generally due within six months of the grant of probate. Who can apply, and what the court looks at, depends on the relationship and the estate.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should I bring to a will appointment?",
    answer:

              A will is the document that says who receives your property, and who has the job of collecting it, when you die. If you live in Melbourne and still own assets in India, one will is not always enough.

          <p style={{ fontSize: "1.08rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink)", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
            In Victoria, a will generally has to be in writing, signed by you, and witnessed by two people who are present at the same time. Those formalities come from the Wills Act 1997 (Vic). A document that does not meet them can fail, or it can force your family into a court application just to have it recognised.
          </p>
          <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
            Marriage can revoke a will made beforehand. Divorce can cancel gifts to a former spouse and their appointment as executor. A will that still names the wrong people, or that ignores a property bought later, is a common reason estates become disputes.
          </p>
          <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
            We take instructions on the assets, the people you want to provide for, and who should be executor. The matters we draft for include:

          <p style={{ fontSize: "1.08rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink)", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
            Land and other immovable property are dealt with under the law of the place where the property is. A flat, a house or farmland in India is not treated the same way as money in an Australian bank account. A single Australian will can cover your Australian estate. For the Indian property, a separate will that meets Indian formalities is often the document a sub-registrar, a bank or a court will accept.
          </p>
          <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
            The two wills have to be drafted together. A later will that says it revokes all earlier wills can wipe out the Australian will without anyone noticing. Each document should say which assets it covers, and that it does not revoke the will made for the other country.
          </p>
          <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
            Succession rules in India are not the same for every religion. What a Hindu, Sikh, Christian or Muslim testator can leave, and to whom, can differ. We ask about that before anything is drafted. Probate or other authority steps in India depend on the city, the asset and the personal law that applies. We explain which of those steps usually remain for your executor in India.

            A will can still be challenged after it is signed. In Victoria, eligible people can apply to the Supreme Court for further provision from an estate under Part IV of the Administration and Probate Act 1958. The claim is not a request to rewrite the will from scratch. The court looks at the relationship, the needs of the applicant, and the size of the estate.
          </p>
          <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
            The usual time limit is six months from the grant of probate or letters of administration. Waiting until the estate has been distributed makes the claim harder. If you have been left out, or if you are an executor who has received a challenge, get advice before that date passes.
          </p>
          <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
            We also advise executors on the practical steps: finding the will, identifying the assets in Australia and overseas, and responding to a family member who says the will is unfair or was not properly signed.
