      "In practical legal terms, the terms are often used interchangeably. 'Commercial agreement' usually refers to agreements regulating recurring business operations—such as supply contracts, service terms, contractor arrangements, or licensing frameworks.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why should I avoid using free online contract templates?",
    answer:
      "Generic internet templates often originate from foreign jurisdictions (such as the US or UK), use outdated legal terminology, and fail to comply with Australian Consumer Law or Victorian statutory requirements, leaving you with an unenforceable agreement when a dispute arises.",
  },
  {

    answer:
      "Yes. We frequently review and update existing business terms to reflect recent changes in unfair contract terms legislation and modern commercial practices.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you protect intellectual property in commercial agreements?",
    answer:
      "We include explicit intellectual property clauses that clearly state who owns pre-existing IP, who owns newly created materials or deliverables, and whether any license is conditional on full payment.",
  },

    question: "How do I get started with drafting a new commercial agreement?",
