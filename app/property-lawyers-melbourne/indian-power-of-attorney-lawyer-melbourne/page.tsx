The Indian Ministry of External Affairs says a document apostilled by a member country should not need a further consular attestation. A bank or local office can still ask for something more, so that should be checked against what the receiving authority wants.",

In practice the attorney, or a local adviser, presents it for adjudication and pays the duty assessed. The amount depends on the state and on whether the power is general or authorises a dealing with immovable property. If it is presented after three months, the authority may refuse to treat it as duly stamped, and a penalty can apply.",

    text: "Not every power of attorney has to be registered. A power that creates, assigns or extinguishes a right in immovable property generally must be registered with the Sub-Registrar for the area where the property is. The attorney presents it in India. You do not have to travel for that appointment. A narrower authority, such as permission to present one document, is not always treated the same way.",

    text: "Once the document has been accepted, the attorney can do only what it authorises: sign a sale or gift deed, deal with a bank, or attend an authority.

    question: "Can Bansal Lawyers prepare a power of attorney for use in India?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We help clients in Melbourne draft or review a power of attorney intended for use in India. What the document should say depends on the transaction, the person you are appointing, and the office in India that will rely on it. We are not a notary public. Where the document must be signed before a notary, we refer you to one.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between a general and a special power of attorney?",
    answer:
      "A general power of attorney gives broader authority to manage affairs. A special, or specific, power of attorney is limited to a named act, such as selling one property or operating one account. A narrower document is often easier for a buyer, bank or registrar to accept, and it limits what the attorney can do.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does a power of attorney transfer my property in India?",
    answer:
      "No. A power of attorney authorises someone to act for you. It does not itself transfer title. Where land is being sold or gifted, the attorney uses the power to sign the transaction documents. Those documents, and any registration they require, are separate from the power of attorney.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you notarize the power of attorney?",
    answer:
      "No. Bansal Lawyers is not a notary public. For use in India, the document is commonly signed before a notary public and then apostilled by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. We prepare or review the document, explain that signing step, and refer you to a notary public to complete it. Some banks and local offices still ask for a particular form of attestation, so we check the purpose of the document before you attend the notary.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does the power of attorney also need to be stamped or registered in India?",
    answer:
      "Often, yes. An instrument executed outside India may need to be stamped or adjudicated after it arrives in India, and a power that deals with immovable property may need to be registered. The rules differ by state and by the type of power. We explain what usually still has to happen in India so your attorney or local adviser can complete those steps.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should I bring to the appointment?",
    answer:
      "Photo identification, the full names and addresses of you and the person you are appointing, and the details of the property, account or matter. If you already have a draft from India, or a list of powers a bank or buyer has asked for, bring that as well.",

              A power of attorney lets you appoint a person in India to do specified acts on your behalf.
              Clients usually need one because they cannot travel for a property sale, a bank requirement,
              a land-record step, or a document that must be signed in person.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              The useful document is the one that matches the transaction. A broad power can be rejected,
              or it can authorise more than you intended. A special power that names the property, the
              account or the act is often what a buyer, bank or sub-registrar asks to see.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              We take instructions in Melbourne and draft or review the power. We are not a notary public.
              If the document needs to be signed before a notary, we refer you to one. Consultations are
              available in English, Hindi and Punjabi. Stamping, adjudication and
              registration, where they are required, are completed in India and depend on the state and
              the office that will rely on the document.

              If a bank, buyer or relative in India has already sent a draft, we review it against what
              you actually want the attorney to do. Signing a draft you have not read is a common source
              of delay, because the receiving office then asks for a fresh document.

            <h2>What a Power of Attorney Does Not Do</h2>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink)", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
              A power of attorney is authority to act. It is not a sale deed, a gift deed or a transfer of
              title. Indian courts have treated a power, even with a sale agreement and a will, as
              insufficient by itself to convey ownership of land. If the aim is to sell or gift property,
              the attorney must still complete the transaction documents that the law requires.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              The power should also be no wider than the job. Authority to sell one flat should not be
              drafted as authority to deal with every asset you own. You can revoke a power, but
              revocation has to be communicated to the attorney and, where the power has been relied on,
              to the people who may act on it.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              This page is about a power of attorney prepared in Australia for use in India. It is separate
              from an Australian enduring power of attorney under Victorian law. If you need both, we can
              explain which document does which job.
