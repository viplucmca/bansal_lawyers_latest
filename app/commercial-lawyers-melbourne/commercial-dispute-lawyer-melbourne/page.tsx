  {
    question: "What is a commercial dispute?",
    answer:
      "A commercial dispute is a disagreement between businesses, or between a business and another party, arising out of a commercial relationship. Common examples include unpaid invoices, breach of contract, disputed work, partnership disagreements and lease issues. The appropriate response depends on the contract and the facts.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should I send a legal notice before taking further steps?",
    answer:
      "Often yes. Many contracts require a notice of breach before other steps can be taken, and a clear written notice can prompt a resolution without further cost. However, a notice should be prepared carefully, because the wording and any admissions in it can affect your position later.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do all commercial disputes end up in court?",
    answer:
      "No. Most commercial disputes are resolved through negotiation, a demand for payment or mediation. Court and tribunal proceedings are an option where those steps do not produce a result, but the cost, time and risk involved should be weighed against the likely recovery.",
  },
  {
    question: "How important is the written contract in a dispute?",
    answer:
      "It is usually central. The contract sets out the obligations, the notice requirements and often the dispute resolution process that must be followed. Where the contract is unclear or incomplete, the surrounding correspondence and conduct of the parties become more significant.",
  },
  {
    question: "What evidence should I keep if a dispute starts?",
    answer:
      "Keep the contract and any variations, quotes, purchase orders, invoices, delivery records, emails and file notes. A clear record of what was agreed and what was actually done is often the difference between a strong position and a weak one. Avoid deleting correspondence, even if it is unhelpful.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is it worth pursuing a small commercial claim?",
    answer:
      "That depends on the amount involved, the strength of your position and the cost of pursuing it. In some cases a negotiated outcome or a well-drafted demand produces a better result than proceedings. We give a practical assessment rather than assuming litigation is the answer.",

              Most commercial disputes start with something small: an invoice that is not paid, a
              deliverable that does not match the brief, or an obligation that one party believes was
              never part of the deal. Left alone, those issues tend to harden, and positions become more
              difficult to move.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              Early advice usually produces a better outcome than waiting. It allows the contract and the
              correspondence to be reviewed while the facts are fresh, and it gives time to consider
              negotiation before a dispute becomes entrenched.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              We also take a practical view of cost. Pursuing a point to its end is not always the best
              commercial outcome, particularly where the cost of doing so outweighs what might be
              recovered. Every dispute depends on its own facts, documents and commercial context.

              The right steps depend on the contract and the circumstances, but the process usually
              involves the following stages:
            </p>
            <ul className="points-list" style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }}>
              {disputeSteps.map((item) => (
                <li key={item}>{item}</li>
              ))}

            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "1.25rem" }}>
              Many commercial contracts require the parties to attempt negotiation or mediation before
              proceedings are commenced. Following that process is not simply a formality; ignoring it can
              create difficulties later, and in some cases it produces a resolution at a fraction of the
              cost of a hearing.

            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink)", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
              Delay can work against you. Time limits may apply, evidence can become harder to gather, and
              the other party may take steps of their own in the meantime. Correspondence sent without
              advice can also complicate a position that was otherwise straightforward.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              If you have received a legal notice or a demand letter, it should be reviewed before you
              respond. A reply written in the wrong terms can limit your options, particularly if it
              contains an admission or a concession you did not intend to make.
            </p>

              Where money is owed, we can also assist with debt recovery and, where appropriate, with
