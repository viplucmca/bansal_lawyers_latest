If you'd like Hindi or Punjabi, tell us when you book and we'll confirm availability. If you already have a court date, mention that too.",

Some of these questions can feel personal, especially when family and money are tangled together. You can answer in English, Hindi or Punjabi, and there's no rush. If something isn't clear yet, say so and we'll work it out together.",

  },
  {
    question: "Can a lawyer help with child custody and parenting arrangements?",

    question: "How long do I have to settle property after separation?",
    answer:
      "If you were married, generally 12 months from the date your divorce takes effect. If you were in a de facto relationship, two years from the end of the relationship. We help with property settlements involving assets, debts, super, business interests and other financial arrangements.",

    question: "Can you help with family violence and intervention orders?",

  },
  {
    question: "When should I contact a family lawyer?",
    answer:
      "As early as you can. Maybe you're separating, or dealing with parenting issues, or you've been served with legal documents, or you're worried about property or safety. Any of those is a good time.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a divorce take in Melbourne?",
    answer:
      "You need to be separated for 12 months before you can apply. After you file, timing depends on how busy the court is. If you have no children under 18, you often don't have to attend the hearing. Once the divorce order is made, it takes effect one month and one day later, and that's when the divorce becomes final.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I have to go to court to sort out parenting arrangements?",
    answer:
      "Not always. Many parents reach agreement through negotiation or mediation and then make it official with consent orders. Court is usually the next step when agreement isn't possible, or when safety is a concern.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is property divided after separation?",
    answer:
      "There's no fixed formula. The court looks at what each person has contributed, financially and otherwise, and what each of you will need going forward. Then it decides on an outcome that's just and equitable.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a time limit for property settlement?",
    answer:
      "Yes. For married couples, generally 12 months from when the divorce takes effect. For de facto couples, two years from the end of the relationship. After that, you need the court's permission to apply, and it isn't guaranteed.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get an intervention order without going to court?",
    answer:
      "Not quite. Only a court can make an intervention order. But you don't always have to wait for a hearing to be protected. In some situations, police can issue a family violence safety notice on the spot. That gives you temporary protection until a court decides whether to make an intervention order.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get divorced in Australia if I got married in India?",
    answer:
      "Often, yes. You can apply here if your marriage is recognised in Australia and either you or your spouse is an Australian citizen, regards Australia as home and intends to live here indefinitely, or has ordinarily lived here for 12 months before filing. You also need to have been separated for 12 months. You must file your marriage certificate, with an English translation if it's not in English. If you can't find the certificate, the court asks for an affidavit explaining why. If you're not sure your marriage is recognised, talk to us before you file.",

          <p style={proseLead}>
            If you or your spouse live in Australia, Australian family law can deal with your divorce, parenting and
            property issues, even if you married in India. It depends on things like citizenship, how long you&apos;ve
            lived here and whether your marriage is recognised in Australia.
          </p>
          <p style={proseBody}>
            The questions we hear from Indian-Australian families are often a mix. Some people married in India and
            separated in Melbourne. Some have parents or in-laws who put money into a home or business. Others have
            children and relatives in two countries, and everyone has a view on what should happen. If you want an Indian
            Family Lawyer Melbourne can offer for that kind of mix, we start by listening. Then we explain what
            Australian law says about your situation. Our work as Family Lawyers for Indian Community Melbourne families
            can call on is to make the law clear so you can decide what to do next.

          <p style={proseBody}>
            You can apply for a divorce once you&apos;ve been{" "}
            <Link href="/family-lawyers-melbourne/divorce-lawyer-melbourne/">separated for 12 months</Link>. That time can
            include months spent under the same roof, as long as you can show the court you were really separated. If you
            married in India, you can still apply here when the marriage is recognised in Australia and you meet the
            citizenship or residency requirements. You&apos;ll need your marriage certificate, with an English translation
            if it&apos;s in another language.
          </p>
          <p style={proseBody}>
            A divorce only ends the marriage. Parenting and property are separate. If you have children under 18, the
            court also has to be satisfied they&apos;re being properly cared for before it makes the order.
          </p>
          <p style={proseBody}>
            Our Indian Divorce Lawyers Melbourne service starts with a conversation in English, Hindi
            or Punjabi. As{" "}
            <Link href="/family-lawyers-melbourne/divorce-lawyer-melbourne/">divorce lawyers in Melbourne</Link>, we
            prepare the application, explain what the court will look at and help you plan what comes next.
          </p>

          <h3 style={h3Style}>Parenting Arrangements and Child Custody</h3>
          <p style={proseBody}>
            People often say &ldquo;custody&rdquo;. The Family Law Act talks about parenting arrangements and parenting
            orders, and the court&apos;s main question is what&apos;s best for the child. Since 6 May 2024, there&apos;s
            no automatic presumption that parents share decision-making equally. Each case is looked at on its own facts.
          </p>
          <p style={proseBody}>
            Before going to court, most parents have to try family dispute resolution (mediation). There are exceptions,
            such as family violence or urgency. Our{" "}
            <Link href="/family-lawyers-melbourne/child-custody-lawyer-melbourne/">

            can help with parenting arrangements, negotiations, consent orders and court if it comes to that. We can also
            explain where child support fits in.
          </p>

          <h3 style={h3Style}>Property Settlement After Separation</h3>
          <p style={proseBody}>
            Property settlement covers more than the house. Savings, loans, investments, a business and debts all count,
            and super is treated as property that can be split. Assets in India, like land, a flat or a family business
            interest, can be part of the picture too. But an Australian order may be hard to enforce overseas, so you
            need advice on that early.
          </p>
          <p style={proseBody}>
            Time limits matter. If you were married, you generally have 12 months from the date your divorce takes effect
            to apply to court. De facto couples generally have two years from the end of the relationship. After that,
            you need the court&apos;s permission.

          <h2>Family Law Issues Affecting Indian-Australian Families</h2>
          <p style={proseLead}>
            Indian-Australian families often ask us the same few questions. Here are straight answers to the most common
            ones, from marriages in India to family money and property overseas. They&apos;re general information on
            Indian Family Law Melbourne matters, so they can&apos;t replace advice on your own situation. If you&apos;d like to talk to someone first, visit our page for{" "}

          <h3 style={h3Style}>Divorce after a marriage in India</h3>
          <p style={proseBody}>
            Divorce After Indian Marriage Australia is usually possible when the marriage is recognised here and you or
            your spouse meet the citizenship or residency requirements. You still need 12 months of separation. When
            you&apos;re ready to apply, our{" "}
            <Link href="/family-lawyers-melbourne/divorce-lawyer-melbourne/">divorce lawyers in Melbourne</Link> can
            prepare the paperwork.
          </p>
          <h3 style={h3Style}>Marriage certificates and translations</h3>
          <p style={proseBody}>
            Indian Marriage Divorce Australia applications need a copy of your marriage certificate. If it isn&apos;t in
            English, the court wants an English translation attached to an affidavit from the
            translator. If you can&apos;t get a certificate for a marriage overseas, you can file an affidavit explaining
            why and giving details of the ceremony, so it&apos;s worth trying the authority where you married first.
          </p>
          <h3 style={h3Style}>Money from parents or extended family</h3>
          <p style={proseBody}>
            Gifts, loans and contributions from parents can come up in a property settlement. How they&apos;re treated
            depends on the facts and the paperwork, so keep bank transfers and any written agreements.
          </p>
          <h3 style={h3Style}>Property or financial interests in India</h3>
          <p style={proseBody}>
            Australian courts can take overseas property into account, but enforcing an order abroad can be hard. Getting
            this right is a big part of Overseas Property Settlement Australia matters. Our{" "}

            can look at what&apos;s held overseas alongside what&apos;s here.

          <h3 style={h3Style}>Parenting with family overseas</h3>
          <p style={proseBody}>
            Grandparents, relatives or a parent in India can be part of the picture. Travel to India, long holidays and
            relocation can be dealt with in parenting orders or consent orders, so it&apos;s worth getting the
            arrangements in writing.
          </p>
