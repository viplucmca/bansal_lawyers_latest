    question: "When should I have a property contract reviewed?",
    answer:
      "Before you sign. Once you have signed, you are generally bound by the terms, subject to any cooling-off rights that apply. A review before signing gives you the chance to ask questions, negotiate changes and understand the deadlines that apply to you.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a cooling-off period?",
    answer:
      "In Victoria, a cooling-off period generally applies to private residential sales, giving a buyer a short time after signing to reconsider. There are exceptions, and the period does not apply in every situation, such as at auction or where a buyer has already obtained legal advice and signed the required certificate. The rules depend on the circumstances of your purchase.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a finance condition and why does it matter?",
    answer:
      "A finance condition makes the contract conditional on you obtaining approval for your loan by a set date. Without it, you may be required to complete the purchase even if your finance is not approved. The wording and the deadline both matter, and lenders sometimes need more time than buyers expect.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should I check before signing a contract of sale?",
    answer:
      "At a minimum, the parties, the property description, the inclusions, the deposit, any conditions, the settlement date and the special conditions. The section 32 documents also need review, because they disclose matters affecting the property that may influence your decision.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can the contract be changed before I sign?",
    answer:
      "Often yes, particularly where a special condition needs to be added or amended. Whether the seller will agree depends on the market and the circumstances. Raising an issue before signing is far easier than trying to deal with it after the contract is binding.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if settlement is delayed?",
    answer:
      "The contract usually sets out what happens if a party cannot complete on the settlement date, including any notice requirements and consequences. Delays can arise from finance, document issues or a party not being ready. If a settlement problem arises, advice should be sought promptly because deadlines matter.",

            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.08rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink)", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
              Buying property is one of the larger financial commitments most people make, and it is
              usually made under time pressure. The contract arrives, the agent wants a decision, and the
              conditions and deadlines are easy to skim past.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              The contract of sale sets out what you are buying, what you must pay and by when, and what
              happens if a condition is not met. The section 32 documents disclose matters affecting the
              property, such as planning controls, easements and building permits. Together they determine
              what you are actually agreeing to.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              We review those documents and explain them in plain language, so you can decide with a clear
              understanding of the risks. Every purchase depends on the property, the contract and your
              individual circumstances.

            <h2>What to Check in a Contract of Sale</h2>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink)", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
              The terms that matter will depend on the property and the sale, but the following points
              should always be clear before you sign:
            </p>
            <ul className="points-list" style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }}>
              {contractPoints.map((item) => (
                <li key={item}>{item}</li>
              ))}
            </ul>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "1.25rem" }}>
              Inclusions and exclusions are a common source of disagreement. If you are expecting the
              dishwasher, the air conditioning units or a particular fixture to stay, the contract should
              say so. It is also worth checking whether the property is affected by an owners corporation
              and, if so, what the fees and rules involve.

            <h2>Risks of Buying Without Legal Advice</h2>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink)", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
              Without a review, it is easy to miss a condition that has to be satisfied by a particular
              date, or a special condition that shifts an obligation onto you. Missing a finance or
              inspection deadline can leave you bound to complete even if your circumstances change.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              The section 32 documents can also raise issues that affect value or future use, such as
              proposed developments nearby, unapproved building work or an easement across the land. Those
              matters are easier to deal with before you are committed.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              Where a problem does arise after signing, we can assist with settlement issues and, if
              necessary, with property notices and disputes.
