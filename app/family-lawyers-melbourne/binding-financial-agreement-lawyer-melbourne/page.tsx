              Binding financial agreements and consent orders are different

              Consent orders are commonly used to formalise family law property or

              parties, but it must meet strict legal requirements under the
              Family Law Act.

            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.12rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink)", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
              Independent legal advice is an important part of binding
              financial agreement matters. Each party should understand the
              effect of the agreement, the advantages, disadvantages, and
              possible risks before signing.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              Signing without proper advice can create problems later. In fact,
              under Australian family law, a financial agreement is not binding
              unless each party has received independent legal advice from their
              own Australian legal practitioner and obtained a signed statement
              confirming this.

              Binding financial agreements need careful review, clear advice, and
              proper documentation. The agreement can affect major financial
              decisions, so it should not be treated as a simple form.
