  {
    question: "What should I do immediately after being charged by police in Melbourne?",
    answer:
      "Carefully preserve all paperwork provided by police (the charge sheet, summons, or bail undertaking), refrain from discussing the matter on social media or with potential witnesses, exercise your right to silence if further questions are asked, and contact a criminal defence lawyer immediately. Early legal intervention allows you to understand the charges and establish a cohesive defence strategy before court deadlines expire.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between summary and indictable offences in Victoria?",
    answer:
      "Summary offences are less serious offences heard and determined exclusively by a magistrate in the Magistrates' Court (such as minor traffic offences, common assault, or low-level property damage). Indictable offences are more serious crimes (such as serious assault, major fraud, or commercial drug trafficking) that are usually commenced in the Magistrates' Court but may proceed to the County Court or Supreme Court for trial before a judge and jury.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can criminal charges be dropped before the case goes to trial?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Through a process called Summary Case Conferencing or pre-trial negotiations, a defence lawyer can identify evidentiary weaknesses, missing proof, or legal defences in the prosecution's brief and make formal representations to the police prosecutor or Office of Public Prosecutions to have charges withdrawn or amended to less serious offences.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the Criminal Diversion Program?",
    answer:
      "The Magistrates' Court Criminal Diversion Program allows eligible accused persons (typically first-time offenders facing low-level summary offences) to acknowledge responsibility without a criminal conviction being recorded. If the police prosecutor recommends diversion and the magistrate approves, the accused person completes agreed conditions (such as a donation, counselling, or letter of apology), and the charge is formally discharged.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does a criminal conviction affect employment and international travel?",
    answer:
      "A recorded criminal conviction appears on standard National Police Checks, which can bar entry into licensed professions, government roles, education, finance, and security. Convictions also carry significant immigration consequences, including potential visa cancellations for non-citizens under the Migration Act character test, and travel restrictions to countries like the United States and Canada.",

              The criminal justice system in Victoria is adversarial, complex, and governed by strict evidentiary

              steps you take in the earliest stages often dictate the final outcome of your case.
