    question: "Do partners need a written partnership agreement?",
    answer:
      "Yes, it is strongly advisable. Without a written agreement, the statutory rules and general partnership law apply, and they may not reflect what the partners actually intended. A written agreement records how the business is run, how profits are shared and what happens when a partner leaves.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between a partnership and a company?",
    answer:
      "A partnership is a relationship between two or more people carrying on a business together for profit. Partners are generally personally responsible for the debts of the business. A company is a separate legal entity, which changes how liability, tax and ownership are treated. The right structure depends on the business and the people involved.",
  },
  {
    question: "How are profits usually shared in a partnership?",
    answer:
      "That depends entirely on what the partners agree. Some partnerships split profits equally, while others use a formula that reflects capital contributed, time worked or the value of each partner's client base. What matters is that the method is recorded clearly so there is no argument later.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if one partner wants to leave?",
    answer:
      "Without a written agreement, the process can be unclear and disruptive. A partnership agreement can set out the notice required, how the departing partner's share is valued, and how the remaining partners can buy that interest. That gives everyone a defined path rather than a negotiation under pressure.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can a partnership agreement deal with disputes?",
    answer:
      "Yes. It can set out a structured process, such as requiring the partners to attempt mediation before taking further steps. Agreeing to that process in advance makes it easier to resolve a disagreement without damaging the business.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help where partners are already in dispute?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can review the partnership agreement, the business records and the correspondence, explain your position, and advise on negotiation or further steps. What is appropriate depends on the terms of the agreement, the conduct of the partners and the outcome you are seeking.",

            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.08rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink)", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
              Partnerships often begin between people who already trust each other. Because of that trust,
              the practical arrangements are rarely written down. Each partner has a general sense of who
              does what and how the money is split, and the business runs on that understanding.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              The difficulty comes when something changes. A partner takes on less work, wants to bring in
              someone new, or decides to leave. At that point, the informal understanding is no longer
              enough, and the partners discover they remember the arrangement differently.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              A written partnership agreement sets out the terms clearly from the start. It covers roles,
              contributions, profit sharing, decision-making and exits. Every partnership is different,
              and the right terms depend on the business, the partners and their individual circumstances.

            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink)", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
              The terms needed will depend on the business, but most partnership agreements should deal
              with the following:
            </p>
            <ul className="points-list" style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }}>
              {partnershipTerms.map((item) => (
                <li key={item}>{item}</li>
              ))}
            </ul>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "1.25rem" }}>
              Capital contributions also deserve attention. If one partner puts in significantly more
              than another, the agreement should record how that contribution is treated, whether it is
              repaid on exit, and how it affects profit sharing. Leaving that unresolved is a common
              source of dispute between partners.
            </p>

          <div style={{ maxWidth: "52rem", margin: "0 auto" }}>
            <span className="eyebrow">Risk</span>
            <h2>The Risk of an Informal Partnership</h2>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink)", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
              Where there is no written agreement, the partners are left with the default rules and
              whatever they can prove about their arrangement. That can produce outcomes none of them
              expected. A partner may be entitled to end the partnership on short notice, or the business
              may have to be wound up to separate the partners&apos; interests.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              Partners in an informal arrangement can also be exposed personally to the business&apos;s
              debts, because a partnership is not a separate legal entity in the way a company is.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              Agreeing the terms while the partnership is working well is far easier than negotiating them
              during a dispute. Where a disagreement has already begun, we can also assist with commercial
              disputes and related notices.
