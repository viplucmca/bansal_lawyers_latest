    question: "What constitutes a breach of contract under Victorian law?",
    answer:
      "A breach of contract occurs when a party fails or refuses to perform one or more obligations without lawful excuse. This can include non-payment, delivering defective goods or services, missing contractual milestones, or attempting to terminate without adhering to agreed notice terms. Breaches are categorized as minor warranties or substantial breaches of essential conditions that may give rise to termination rights.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are verbal agreements legally binding in Victoria?",
    answer:
      "Yes, verbal agreements can be legally binding in Victoria provided the essential elements of a contract exist: an offer, acceptance, consideration, and an intention to create legal relations. However, verbal agreements are significantly harder to prove. Courts examine contemporaneous emails, text messages, bank transfers, invoices, and the conduct of the parties to reconstruct the terms agreed upon.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why is it important to seek advice before issuing a breach notice?",
    answer:
      "Issuing a breach notice incorrectly or terminating a contract without valid legal grounds can constitute 'repudiation' of the contract. This can inadvertently expose you to substantial damages claims from the other party. Independent legal advice ensures that any notice strictly complies with the contract's dispute mechanisms, cure periods, and formal service requirements.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can contract disputes be resolved without going to court?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Most contract disputes are resolved through informal discussions, formal solicitor correspondence, or structured mediation. Many modern contracts contain dispute resolution clauses that mandate negotiation or mediation prior to commencing litigation. Resolving matters via a formal Deed of Settlement saves substantial legal costs, management time, and business disruption.",
  },
  {
    question: "What remedies are available for breach of contract?",
    answer:
      "The primary remedy in civil contract disputes is compensatory damages, designed to place the innocent party in the position they would have occupied had the contract been properly performed. In certain specific circumstances, courts or tribunals may order specific performance, restitution, injunctions, or rescission of the agreement.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long do I have to bring a breach of contract claim in Victoria?",
    answer:
      "Under the Limitation of Actions Act 1958 (Vic), the statutory limitation period for bringing a breach of contract action is generally six years from the date the breach occurred. However, contractual dispute clauses often impose much shorter notification deadlines, so early advice is critical.",

              Contracts form the foundation of commercial trade, professional services, property deals,
              and private agreements. However, disagreements often arise when expectations diverge,
              deliverables fail to meet standards, invoices are unpaid, or ambiguous terms lead to
              conflicting interpretations.

              Rushing to terminate a contract, withholding payments without a clear legal right, or sending
