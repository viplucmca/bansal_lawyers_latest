          <p style={{ fontSize: "1.08rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink)", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
            A contract only works if everyone reads it the same way. Many disputes come down to vague wording, missing terms or clauses that favour one side.

            Our contract lawyers review, draft and advise on business contracts, service agreements, shareholder agreements, partnership agreements and other commercial documents. With shareholder and partnership agreements, we look at how decisions get made, how shares can be transferred, and what happens if someone wants to leave or the owners can&apos;t agree.

          <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>

            Buying or selling a business is a big decision. The contract, lease terms, assets, liabilities, employee entitlements and settlement conditions all need a close look before you commit.

          <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>

          <p style={{ fontSize: "1.08rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink)", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
            Business disputes eat into cash flow, operations, relationships and reputation, and they usually cost more the longer they run. Acting early generally leaves you with more options.

          <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
            Our commercial dispute lawyers help with contract disputes, negotiation, settlement and court steps where they&apos;re needed. For unpaid debts, we can send a letter of demand and prepare legal notices. If a company owes you money, we can also prepare a statutory demand under the Corporations Act. The company then has 21 days to pay the debt or apply to the court to have the demand set aside.

                Claims have time limits. In Victoria, the general limit for a breach of contract claim is six years from when the breach happened. Some situations differ, for example contracts signed as deeds. If you think you may have a claim, get advice sooner rather than later.
