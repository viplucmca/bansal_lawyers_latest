    question: "What happens if a buyer or seller cannot settle on the due date in Victoria?",
    answer:
      "If a party cannot complete settlement on the agreed date, the non-defaulting party typically issues a formal Notice of Default (often providing 14 days under standard Victorian contracts). The default notice specifies the breach, calculates penalty interest under the contract, and warns that failure to remedy will result in rescission of the contract, forfeiture of deposit, and potential liability for any resale deficiency.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I terminate a property contract if the vendor's section 32 statement is inaccurate?",
    answer:
      "Under section 32K of the Sale of Land Act 1962 (Vic), a purchaser may have a statutory right to rescind a contract of sale prior to settlement if the vendor failed to supply a section 32 statement, gave false or misleading information, or failed to disclose a required matter, provided the purchaser acted reasonably. Strict conditions apply, and prompt legal advice is essential.",
  },
  {
    question: "Where are property-related disputes heard in Victoria?",
    answer:
      "Jurisdiction depends on the nature and value of the dispute. Many retail tenancy, residential lease, co-ownership, and domestic building disputes are heard by the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT). High-value contract of sale disputes, deposit claims, and specific performance actions are typically litigated in the County Court or Supreme Court of Victoria.",
  },
  {
    question: "How are commercial lease disputes regarding 'make-good' resolved?",
    answer:
      "Make-good disputes arise at the expiration of a commercial lease when the landlord and tenant disagree on the required state of repair, removal of tenant fit-outs, or reinstatement of the premises. Resolving these disputes requires a careful comparison of the original condition report, lease covenants, depreciation factors, and independent expert scope-of-work valuations.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a co-ownership property dispute under Victorian law?",
    answer:
      "When joint proprietors or tenants in common cannot agree on whether to sell, renovate, or divide real property, Part IV of the Property Law Act 1958 (Vic) empowers VCAT to make orders for the sale of the land, division of proceeds, or physical partition, including accounting for mortgage payments and property improvements.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can property disputes be resolved out of court?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Most property disputes are resolved through urgent without-prejudice negotiations, deed of variation of settlement dates, or mediated Deeds of Settlement and Release. Out-of-court resolutions save substantial conveyancing delays, prevent property market devaluation risks, and avoid high court costs.",

              Real estate transactions, leases, and co-ownership arrangements carry substantial financial stakes.

              a delayed settlement, or a commercial landlord and tenant dispute outgoings or repair obligations,
              the consequences of inaction can be severe.
