              <strong>Ministerial Intervention</strong> is a discretionary power

              Immigration to substitute a more favourable decision after an
              adverse decision by the Administrative Review Tribunal (ART). It
              is most commonly used under <strong>section 351</strong> (visa
              refusals and cancellations, including protection matters) or{" "}

              Under the current Ministerial Instructions (September 2025), the
              Department only refers requests that meet at least one of the
              specific criteria in section 13 of the Instructions. Common
              examples include:

              Requests that fall outside these criteria, or that meet any

              when a bridging visa could have been applied for, or making a
              repeat request within two years), are finalised without referral to
              the Minister.
