                  A landmark case that highlights the importance of the Closing Loopholes reforms is the decision involving Amita Gupta and Uber Eats. Ms. Gupta, a delivery driver for Uber Eats, challenged her classification as an independent contractor after being permanently blocked from the platform in January 2019. She argued that she was effectively an employee and sought an unfair dismissal remedy under the Fair Work Act 2009.

                <p>
                  Ms. Gupta worked as a delivery driver for Uber Eats, completing over 2,200 deliveries between 2017 and 2019. She used her own car and had the flexibility to log in and out of the Uber Eats app at her discretion. However, Uber Eats maintained significant control over her work through its ratings system, service standards, and the ability to deactivate her account for poor performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2019, Ms. Gupta was permanently blocked from the platform for failing to meet Uber Eats’ delivery standards. She filed an unfair dismissal claim, arguing that she was an employee of Portier Pacific Pty Ltd (Uber Eats’ Australian entity) and was entitled to protections under the Fair Work Act.

                  The Decision
                </h3>
                <p>
                  The Fair Work Commission initially ruled that Ms. Gupta was not an employee, citing her flexibility and lack of obligation to accept work. However, on appeal, the Full Bench of the Fair Work Commission examined the true nature of the relationship. The key findings included:
                </p>
                <ul style={{ margin: "0 0 1rem 1.5rem", display: "grid", gap: "0.5rem", listStyleType: "disc" }}>
                  <li>Ms. Gupta was not running her own business but was working within Uber Eats’ business model.</li>
                  <li>Uber Eats controlled key aspects of her work, including the delivery fee structure, performance standards, and customer interactions.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Despite this, Ms. Gupta was ultimately found not to be an employee due to her ability to choose when and whether to work, her lack of exclusivity, and the absence of branding or representation as part of Uber Eats’ business.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Full Bench concluded that Ms. Gupta was not an employee but acknowledged the complexity of the case and the broader implications for gig economy workers.

                  How the Reforms Would Apply
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Under the Closing Loopholes reforms, cases like Ms. Gupta’s would likely have a different outcome. The reforms focus on the actual working relationship rather than the written contract, ensuring that workers who are effectively employees are not misclassified. For gig economy workers like Ms. Gupta, the reforms provide:
                </p>
                <ul style={{ margin: "0 0 0 1.5rem", display: "grid", gap: "0.5rem", listStyleType: "disc" }}>
                  <li>Stronger protections against unfair deactivation or dismissal.</li>
                  <li>Clearer contracts that reflect the true nature of the working relationship.</li>
                  <li>The ability to challenge unfair contract terms.</li>
                </ul>
