  {
    question: "What is the difference between debt recovery and a debt dispute?",
    answer:
      "A straightforward debt recovery matter involves an undisputed amount that the debtor simply has not paid due to liquidity issues. A debt dispute arises when the debtor actively contests their liability—for example, alleging that services were defective, goods were delivered late, pricing was incorrect, or that an offset or counter-claim applies. Disputed debts require a thorough legal assessment rather than routine debt collection.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should be included in a formal Letter of Demand for a debt?",
    answer:
      "A formal Letter of Demand must accurately identify the debtor entity, specify the exact amount claimed and the basis of the obligation (citing contracts or invoices), attach supporting evidence, provide a reasonable deadline for payment (typically 7 to 14 days), and clearly state the legal steps that will follow non-compliance, such as court proceedings or interest claims under the Penalty Interest Rates Act 1983 (Vic).",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the risks of delaying action on an unpaid debt?",
    answer:
      "Delaying recovery action increases the risk that the debtor may become insolvent, transfer assets, or close their business. Over time, evidence weakens, memories fade, and key witnesses move on. Additionally, under the Limitation of Actions Act 1958 (Vic), debts generally become statute-barred and legally unenforceable after six years from the date the cause of action accrued.",
  },
  {
    question: "How should I respond if someone issues an unfair debt claim against me?",
    answer:
      "Do not ignore the claim. Promptly review the invoices and contracts to identify any valid defences—such as unperformed work, failure of consideration, defective delivery, or lack of prior agreement on price. Seek legal advice to prepare a formal response denying liability on substantiated grounds, which can deter unfounded court action.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can debt disputes be settled on repayment terms out of court?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Negotiated settlements often involve agreed lump-sum discounts or structured instalment payment plans. To protect the creditor, such arrangements must be documented in a binding Deed of Settlement, often backed by a consent judgment or personal guarantee to ensure that the full original debt becomes instantly enforceable if a single payment milestone is missed.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which Victorian court or tribunal handles debt disputes?",
    answer:
      "Debts involving consumer transactions, goods, or services up to VCAT's jurisdictional limits can often be heard in the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal. Debt claims up to $100,000 are heard in the Magistrates' Court of Victoria, while larger amounts proceed to the County Court or Supreme Court.",

              Payment disagreements arise across all areas of commerce and private affairs. A client
              refuses to pay an invoice citing quality concerns, a borrower stops meeting loan repayments,
              or a contractor claims variations that were never authorised.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              When an account is genuinely contested, simple debt collection techniques are rarely
              effective. Resolving the matter requires careful analysis of the contract terms, the evidence
              of performance, and the validity of any counter-claims raised.
