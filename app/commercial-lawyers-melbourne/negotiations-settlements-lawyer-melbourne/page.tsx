    question: "Why is a formal Deed of Settlement necessary instead of an email agreement?",
    answer:
      "An informal email agreement often fails to legally extinguish all potential causes of action, leaves terms ambiguous, and lacks enforceable default remedies. A formal Deed of Settlement and Release provides conclusive legal finality under Australian law.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does 'without prejudice' mean in settlement discussions?",
    answer:
      "'Without prejudice' communication allows parties to make concessions and explore compromise during negotiations without those statements being used against them as admissions in court if settlement talks fail.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if the other party defaults on agreed settlement payments?",
    answer:
      "A properly drafted Deed of Settlement includes an acceleration clause and default judgment consent. If the debtor misses an installment, the full balance (often without the negotiated discount) becomes immediately due and payable.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can a settlement be kept strictly confidential?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Most Deeds of Settlement contain robust confidentiality and non-disparagement clauses that prohibit either party from disclosing the terms or circumstances to third parties, protecting commercial reputation.",

    question: "Can Bansal Lawyers negotiate on my behalf without me attending meetings?",
