                  The ART is an independent body that reviews decisions made by
                  the Australian Government, including those made by the
                  Department of Home Affairs regarding visa applications. The
                  ART is specifically designed to ensure that decisions made by
                  government departments are fair, transparent, and just.

                  In October 2024, the ART replaced the Administrative Appeals

                  administrative decisions, including those related to migration
                  and refugee cases. The ART operates with the goal of providing
                  a more efficient and accessible process for challenging

                  Additionally, changes in immigration policies and regulations
                  can also impact visa decisions. Once a visa is refused, the
                  Department of Home Affairs will provide a decision letter
                  outlining the reasons for the refusal.

                  The ART conducts what’s called a “merits review” of your case.
                  This means the ART doesn’t just look at whether the Department
                  of Home Affairs made a legal error. Instead, it examines the
                  entire decision afresh, considering all facts, evidence, and
                  the law as it stands. The ART aims to ensure that decisions
                  are fair and based on all the relevant information.

                  Most ART applications require an upfront application fee, which
                  is $3,727 from 1 July 2026. Applicants who are experiencing
                  financial hardship may be eligible for a 50% fee reduction.
                  Additionally, if your appeal is successful, you may be
                  refunded part of the application fee. For protection visa
                  reviews, no upfront fee is required, but a fee of $2,293 applies
                  if the appeal is unsuccessful.

                  While processing times can vary, the ART typically takes several
                  months to schedule a hearing. For example, cases related to
                  bridging visas may be finalised in around 11 days, while
                  protection visas can take up to 2,249 days.
