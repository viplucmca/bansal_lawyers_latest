                  The Australian Government has set certain requirements that couples must meet to be married under the <em>Family Law Act 1975</em>. To be able to file for divorce in Australia:
                </p>
                <ul

                  }}
                >
                  <li>
                    <strong>Residency requirement:</strong> One of the spouses must be an Australian citizen or permanent resident or have lived in Australia for at least 12 months before the application is filed.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Separation period:</strong> The couple must have been apart for at least 12 months and one day, which shows that the marriage is over.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  A well-prepared application helps the court avoid delays and extra requests. You must have a marriage certificate to file for divorce. If it&apos;s not in English, you must get it translated. In some cases, you might need more documents:

                    A divorce legally ends a marriage, but it doesn&apos;t automatically settle disagreements over property, spousal support, or parenting. These issues need to be dealt with separately and within a certain amount of time after the divorce.

                  In most of the cases, being physically present in court is not necessary. If more information is needed or if it involves children, a short hearing may be set up. Hearings usually don&apos;t last long and are only for making sure the law is being followed.
