    question: "Why should a commercial lease be reviewed before signing?",
    answer:
      "A commercial lease often runs for several years and creates long-term financial obligations. Once it is signed, the terms are difficult to change. A review before signing lets you check the rent and outgoings, the obligations you are taking on, and the conditions attached to any option to renew.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are outgoings and how are they charged?",
    answer:
      "Outgoings are the costs of operating the building, such as rates, insurance, repairs and management fees. In many commercial leases the tenant pays a share, calculated by reference to the area leased. What can be recovered and how it is apportioned depends on the lease, so the wording should be checked carefully.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do options to renew work?",
    answer:
      "An option gives the tenant the right to renew the lease for a further term, provided the conditions in the lease are met. Those conditions often include giving notice within a specified window and not being in default. Missing the notice period can mean the option is lost, so the dates matter.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a make-good obligation?",
    answer:
      "A make-good obligation requires the tenant to restore the premises to a particular condition at the end of the lease. The wording determines what is actually required, and it can involve significant cost. It is worth understanding the obligation before committing to a fit-out.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do Victorian retail leasing rules apply to my lease?",
    answer:
      "The Retail Leases Act applies to certain retail premises and to leases that meet the statutory requirements. Whether it applies to your lease depends on the premises, the permitted use and other factors. The rules affect matters such as disclosure, rent reviews and dispute resolution, so it is worth confirming the position.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can a commercial lease be assigned to someone else?",
    answer:
      "It depends on the lease. Many commercial leases allow assignment only with the landlord's consent, and some set out the process and the information the proposed assignee must provide. Where the business is being sold, the lease assignment is often a key part of the transaction.",

              Taking on commercial premises is often one of the larger commitments a business makes.
              Unlike a residential tenancy, a commercial lease is generally a negotiated document, and the
              terms are largely whatever the parties agree.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              That means the protections you have depend on what the lease actually says. Rent, outgoings,
              repairs, renewal and make-good obligations are all determined by the wording, and a clause
              that seems minor at signing can carry significant cost later.
            </p>

              The terms that matter depend on the premises and the business, but the following should be
              clear before you sign:
            </p>
            <ul className="points-list" style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }}>

              Rent reviews deserve particular attention. A market review can move the rent in either
              direction, while a fixed increase is predictable. The method, the timing and any ratchet
              provision all affect what you will be paying over the term. Depending on the premises and the
              permitted use, Victorian retail leasing legislation may also apply and impose additional
              requirements on the parties.

              A lease that is unclear about outgoings can produce costs the tenant did not anticipate. A
              lease that is silent on assignment can make it difficult to sell the business. A make-good
              obligation that is drafted broadly can require restoration work well beyond what the tenant
              expected.

            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              Renewal options carry their own risk. Where the notice period is missed, the option may be
              lost, and the tenant may be left negotiating a new lease from a weaker position.
            </p>
