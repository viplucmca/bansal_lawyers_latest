  {
    question: "What is the difference between a civil business dispute and a corporate dispute?",
    answer:
      "A civil business dispute generally involves disagreements between a business and external parties—such as suppliers, customers, contractors, or landlords—regarding contracts, payments, or performance. A corporate dispute typically involves internal governance conflicts among shareholders, directors, or partners regarding voting rights, dividend distributions, management control, or breaches of fiduciary duties.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can commercial disputes be settled without public court exposure?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Most commercial disputes are resolved privately through confidential without-prejudice negotiations, mediation, or conciliation conferences. Resolving matters out of court protects your business's reputation, avoids public court records, and allows the parties to agree on flexible commercial terms that a judge cannot order.",
  },
  {
    question: "What steps should I take if a business partner or co-director dispute arises?",
    answer:
      "Review your Partnership Agreement, Shareholder Agreement, or Company Constitution immediately to identify dispute mechanisms, buy-out clauses, and voting rules. Avoid taking unilateral actions, such as locking bank accounts or diverting clients, without legal advice, as this can trigger emergency court injunctions or claims for breach of director duties under the Corporations Act 2001.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the Australian Consumer Law affect B2B disputes in Victoria?",
    answer:
      "The Australian Consumer Law (ACL), found in Schedule 2 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, applies to business-to-business transactions in many circumstances. In particular, section 18 prohibits misleading or deceptive conduct in trade or commerce, and the unfair contract terms regime protects small businesses against one-sided standard-form contracts.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a Deed of Settlement and Release in a business dispute?",
    answer:
      "A Deed of Settlement and Release is a formal, binding contract that resolves the dispute. It typically details any agreed financial settlement, return of property or inventory, non-disparagement covenants, strict confidentiality terms, and comprehensive mutual releases ensuring that neither party can revive the claims in the future.",
  },
  {
    question: "What courts in Melbourne handle business and commercial claims?",
    answer:
      "Minor civil and fair trading claims may be heard in the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT). General commercial disputes up to $100,000 are dealt with in the Magistrates' Court of Victoria. Intermediate and complex commercial litigation is handled by the County Court (Commercial Division) or the Supreme Court of Victoria (Commercial Court).",

              In business, disputes are sometimes an inevitable consequence of commercial growth and operational
              strain. A key client cancels an agreement without notice, a vendor delivers sub-standard components,
              or co-directors reach an impasse regarding the future direction of the enterprise.

              Commercial disputes require an approach that balances legal strength with commercial pragmatism.

              Prolonged commercial litigation drains management focus and incurs substantial financial costs.
              Our priority is to achieve resolution early through structured without-prejudice negotiations,

              When a negotiated outcome is reached, we draft comprehensive Deeds of Settlement and Release
              that contain strict confidentiality, non-disparagement, and release terms. If litigation is
              unavoidable, we represent your business vigorously in Victorian courts.
