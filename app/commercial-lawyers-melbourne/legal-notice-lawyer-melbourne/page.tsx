    question: "What is a legal notice?",
    answer:
      "In commercial matters, a legal notice is a formal written communication that records a party's position and asks for a specific response by a set date. Common examples include a letter of demand for unpaid money and a notice of breach under a contract. Some contracts require a notice before other steps can be taken.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should I send a notice before taking further action?",
    answer:
      "Often yes. A clear notice can resolve a matter without further cost, and many contracts require one. Whether a notice is appropriate, and in what terms, depends on the contract and the facts. It is worth seeking advice before sending one, because the wording can affect your position later.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should a letter of demand include?",
    answer:
      "It should identify the parties correctly, set out the amount or obligation in dispute, explain the basis of the claim, refer to the relevant contract terms, and specify what is required and by when. It should also make clear what will happen if the deadline is not met, without overstating the position.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if the notice is ignored?",
    answer:
      "It depends on the type of notice and the contract. If the deadline passes without a response, the next step might be a further notice, a negotiated settlement, mediation, or court or tribunal proceedings. The appropriate step depends on the strength of the claim and whether the other party has the capacity to pay.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can a poorly worded notice make things worse?",
    answer:
      "Yes. A notice that overstates the claim, misstates the contract, or contains an unintended admission can weaken your position. An aggressive or unclear notice can also push the other party towards their own legal advice rather than resolution. Careful drafting is worth the effort.",
  },
  {
    question: "I have received a notice. What should I do?",
    answer:
      "Read it carefully and note any deadline. Do not ignore it, and do not respond in detail until you have taken advice. A response written in the wrong terms can limit your options, so it is usually best to have the notice and the surrounding documents reviewed first.",

            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.08rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink)", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
              A legal notice is often the point at which a commercial disagreement becomes formal. It may
              be a letter of demand for money, a notice of breach under a contract, or a response to a
              claim made against your business. In each case, the document does more than communicate a
              position; it creates a record that may be referred to later.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              Many commercial contracts set out a required process before further steps can be taken, such
              as giving written notice and allowing a period to remedy the issue. Following that process
              properly matters, and so does the way the notice itself is drafted.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              We prepare notices on behalf of clients and advise clients who have received one. What is
              appropriate in each case depends on the contract, the evidence and the outcome the client is
              seeking.

            <h2>What to Consider Before Sending a Notice</h2>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink)", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
              A notice is more effective when it is grounded in the documents. Before anything is sent, we
              work through the following points:
            </p>
            <ul className="points-list" style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }}>
              {noticeConsiderations.map((item) => (
                <li key={item}>{item}</li>
              ))}
            </ul>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "1.25rem" }}>
              It also helps to be clear about the purpose. A notice intended to prompt payment should read
              differently from one that sets up a formal dispute process. Sending an aggressive notice
              where a short, firm letter would have worked can make resolution harder rather than easier.

          </div>

      <Section tone="warm">

          <div style={{ maxWidth: "52rem", margin: "0 auto" }}>
            <span className="eyebrow">Responding</span>
            <h2>If You Have Received a Notice</h2>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink)", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
              Receiving a notice is not the end of the matter, but it should not be ignored. Many notices
              set a deadline, and a failure to respond within it can have consequences under the contract
              or in any later proceedings.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              Before responding, it is worth reviewing the contract, the notice itself and the
              correspondence that led to it. A reply that concedes a point, or that fails to raise a
              defence that was available, can be difficult to undo. Where the notice is disputed, the
              response should address the specific allegations and set out the position clearly.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              Notices often lead to negotiation. Where a commercial outcome can be reached, a settlement
              recorded properly in writing usually serves both parties better than a prolonged dispute.
