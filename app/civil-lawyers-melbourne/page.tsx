              As legal notice lawyers in Melbourne, we review the dispute, prepare correspondence, respond to claims and advise on practical options. A badly worded notice can weaken your position, and ignoring one can too, so get advice before you send or respond to one.

              Depending on the claim, a matter may be heard in VCAT, the Magistrates&apos; Court of Victoria, the County Court or the Supreme Court. Before starting most court proceedings in Victoria, parties are expected to take genuine steps to resolve the dispute under the Civil Procedure Act 2010, and we help with that step. We also assist with compensation-related claims, including where a breach of contract has caused financial loss.
