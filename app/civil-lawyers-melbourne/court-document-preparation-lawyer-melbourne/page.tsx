  {
    question: "What are pleadings in a Victorian civil court action?",
    answer:
      "Pleadings are formal legal documents exchanged between parties in court proceedings—such as a Statement of Claim, Defence, Counterclaim, and Reply. They define the precise factual issues in dispute, outline the legal basis of claims and defences, and determine what evidence will be admissible at trial. Inadequate pleadings can be struck out by the court.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the Overarching Obligations certification under the Civil Procedure Act 2010 (Vic)?",
    answer:
      "In Victoria, litigants and their lawyers must sign and file an Overarching Obligations Certification when filing court documents. This certifies compliance with statutory duties, including acting honestly, having a proper basis for claims and defences, taking reasonable steps to resolve the dispute, and cooperating to minimise delay and costs.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the risks of filing incomplete or inaccurate court documents?",
    answer:
      "Filing poorly prepared court documents can have severe consequences: claims may be dismissed or struck out; you may face personal adverse costs orders; deadlines may be forfeited; and admissions inadvertently made in unvetted pleadings can be binding and fatal to your case at trial.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does drafting a court affidavit differ from a standard witness statement?",
    answer:
      "An Affidavit is formal sworn evidence. It must be structured into numbered paragraphs, contain only admissible evidence within the direct knowledge of the deponent (avoiding hearsay, speculation, and legal argument), have properly certified and tabbed exhibits, and be witnessed by an authorised affidavit taker under Victorian law.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should I do if I am served with a court complaint or VCAT notice?",
    answer:
      "Act immediately. Victorian courts enforce strict deadlines for filing a Notice of Defence or response (often 21 days from service). Failing to file within the prescribed window can result in the plaintiff obtaining default judgment against you, which can lead to immediate enforcement, bank garnishing, or asset seizure.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can a lawyer help me prepare court documents if I plan to represent myself?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Legal practitioners can provide unbundled legal drafting assistance—preparing compliant Statements of Claim, Defences, or Affidavits that meet procedural court standards—while allowing you to manage self-representation at hearings if you choose.",

              Filing documents with Victorian courts is an irreversible formal step. Pleadings that contain
