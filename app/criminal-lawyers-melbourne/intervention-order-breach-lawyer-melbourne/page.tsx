  {
    question: "Is breaching an intervention order in Victoria a criminal offence?",
    answer:
      "Yes. While applying for or being subject to an Intervention Order (IVO) is a civil court matter, breaching any condition of that order is a criminal offence under Victorian law. A finding of guilt can result in a permanent criminal record, substantial fines, Community Correction Orders, or imprisonment.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if the protected person invited me over or sent the first message?",
    answer:
      "Under Victorian law, only a magistrate can vary or cancel an intervention order. Even if the protected person invites you to their home, calls you, or sends text messages, you will still be legally liable for breaching the order if you respond or attend the prohibited location. The protected person's consent is not a legal defence to a breach charge, although it is a vital mitigating factor at sentencing.",
  },
  {
    question: "What constitutes 'persistent contravention' of an intervention order?",
    answer:
      "Under Section 125A of the Family Violence Protection Act 2008, a person commits persistent contravention if they breach an order on 2 or more occasions within a 28-day period. Persistent contravention is an indictable offence that carries a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment.",
  },
  {
    question: "What must the prosecution prove to convict someone of an IVO breach?",
    answer:
      "The prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that: (1) a valid intervention order or safety notice was in force; (2) the accused had been served with the order or had received explanation of its terms; and (3) the accused intentionally or knowingly engaged in conduct that contravened a condition of the order.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can an IVO breach charge be resolved through the Criminal Diversion Program?",
    answer:
      "In certain circumstances, minor or technical breaches (especially for first-time offenders where no violence, threats, or intimidation occurred) may be considered for the Magistrates' Court Criminal Diversion Program. This requires the consent of the police prosecutor and judicial approval, allowing the matter to be finalised without a criminal conviction.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do Family Court parenting orders interact with an intervention order?",
    answer:
      "Under Section 68R of the Family Law Act 1975, Family Court parenting orders generally override inconsistent state intervention orders to the extent of any inconsistency. Most Victorian intervention orders contain an explicit exception allowing contact or attendance solely for the purpose of complying with a parenting order or written parenting agreement.",

              Intervention orders in Victoria—whether Family Violence Intervention Orders (FVIO) or Personal
              Safety Intervention Orders (PSIO)—impose strict legal restrictions on what a respondent can and
              cannot do. What many people do not realise is that even a single text message, a brief phone call,
              or asking a third party a question can be classified by Victoria Police as a criminal contravention.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              Allegations of breaching an order frequently occur against the backdrop of separation, child
              handover misunderstandings, or mutual communications where the protected person invited contact.
              Regardless of the circumstances, police treat breaches with utmost seriousness. Engaging legal
              counsel immediately is critical to protecting your freedom and criminal record.
