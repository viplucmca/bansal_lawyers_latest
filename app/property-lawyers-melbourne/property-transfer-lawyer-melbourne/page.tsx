    question: "What is a property transfer?",
    answer:
      "A property transfer is the document and process by which ownership of land changes from one party to another. It is lodged with the land registry so that the register reflects the new owner. The steps involved depend on why the transfer is taking place.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does every property transfer involve a sale?",
    answer:
      "No. Transfers also occur between family members, following a relationship change, as part of a business or trust restructure, or under a court order. Because the reason for the transfer affects the process and the documents required, it is important to explain your circumstances from the outset.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does stamp duty apply to a property transfer?",
    answer:
      "Duty may apply, depending on the reason for the transfer and the relationship between the parties. Some transfers attract concessions or exemptions, but the rules are specific and the eligibility requirements must be met. Because duty is assessed on the particular circumstances, it is worth obtaining advice before the documents are prepared.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can a name be added to or removed from a title?",
    answer:
      "Yes, although the process and the consequences depend on the circumstances. Adding a name can affect ownership rights, and removing one may require the consent of a lender or another party. There can also be duty and tax implications, so the position should be considered carefully beforehand.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why do incorrect transfer documents cause problems?",
    answer:
      "A transfer that does not match the title details, names the wrong party or omits a required consent may be rejected at lodgement. That causes delay, and correcting a registered document afterwards is more involved than getting it right initially. Reviewing the documents before lodgement avoids most of these issues.",
  },
  {
    question: "What information do I need to provide?",
    answer:
      "The title details, the names of the parties and how the property is currently held, the reason for the transfer, and any mortgage or other interest affecting the land. If duty or an exemption is relevant, information about the parties' circumstances will also be needed.",
  },

              A property transfer records a change of ownership. It may follow a sale, a family
              arrangement, a relationship change, a business restructure or a court order. The document
              itself looks straightforward, but the requirements around it depend on why the transfer is
              happening.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              We review the title, confirm how the property is currently held, and explain what the
              particular transfer requires. That includes whether a lender&apos;s consent or a discharge
              is needed, whether the title is subject to any restriction, and what documents must be
              lodged.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              The advice depends entirely on the reason for the transfer and the parties involved. Because
              those circumstances affect the documents, the duty position and the practical steps, we will
              ask about them before advising.

            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink)", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
              The requirements vary with the transaction, but we generally work through the following:
            </p>
            <ul className="points-list" style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }}>
              {transferPoints.map((item) => (
                <li key={item}>{item}</li>
              ))}

            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "1.25rem" }}>
              Duty is often the point that surprises people. Whether duty applies, and whether a concession
              or exemption is available, depends on the relationship between the parties and the reason for
              the transfer. Those questions should be considered before the documents are prepared, not
              after they are lodged.

            <h2>Risks of Incorrect Transfer Documents</h2>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink)", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
              A transfer must match the registered title. If the names, the property description or the
              way the title is held do not align, the document may be rejected when it is lodged. That
              causes delay, and in a transaction with a settlement date attached, delay has consequences.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              A transfer can also carry consequences the parties did not intend. Changing who is on the
              title affects ownership rights, and it can affect the position on a mortgage, on duty and on
              any future dealings with the property. Those effects should be understood before the transfer
              takes place.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              Where a transfer forms part of a transaction, we can also assist with contract review and
              settlement issues.
