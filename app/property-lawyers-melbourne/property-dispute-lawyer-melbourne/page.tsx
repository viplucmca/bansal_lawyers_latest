    question: "What kinds of property disputes do you assist with?",
    answer:
      "Common matters include buyer and seller disputes over a contract or a condition, lease disputes between landlords and tenants, settlement delays, disputes about the condition of a property, and disagreements about rent, outgoings, repairs or bonds. What is available in each case depends on the contract, the notices and the evidence.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should I take legal advice before responding to a property notice?",
    answer:
      "Yes, if possible. A property notice often sets a deadline and may require a specific response. A reply written in the wrong terms can limit your options, particularly if it contains a concession. Reviewing the notice and the supporting documents first is the safer approach.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do property disputes always go to court?",
    answer:
      "No. Many property disputes are resolved through negotiation or mediation, and some are resolved by clarifying the contract terms. Where the matter does proceed to a hearing, the relevant forum depends on the type of dispute. Residential tenancy and some other property matters commonly go to VCAT.",
  },
  {
    question: "What evidence matters in a property dispute?",
    answer:
      "The contract or lease, the notices exchanged, correspondence between the parties and their representatives, records of the condition of the property, invoices and receipts. A clear written record of what was agreed and what occurred is usually the most useful evidence.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can a dispute be resolved without ending the transaction?",
    answer:
      "Often yes. Many property disputes are about a specific issue rather than the whole transaction, and a negotiated outcome allows the sale or lease to continue. Whether that is possible depends on the parties and the nature of the dispute.",
  },
  {
    question: "How important is acting quickly in a property dispute?",
    answer:
      "It matters. Property contracts and leases contain deadlines, and some steps must be taken within a set period. Delay can also make evidence harder to gather and may allow the other party to take steps that affect your position. Early advice generally produces more options.",
  },

            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.08rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink)", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
              A property dispute usually begins with something specific: a condition that was not met, a
              settlement that did not happen on time, rent that was not paid, or work that was not done as
              agreed. Left unaddressed, the disagreement tends to widen, and the cost of resolving it
              grows.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              The starting point is always the documents. The contract or lease sets out the obligations,
              the notice requirements and often the process that must be followed before further steps are
              taken. Correspondence and records fill in what actually happened.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              We review the position, explain your options and advise on the most practical way forward.
              Every dispute depends on its own facts, documents and commercial or personal context.

              The right steps depend on the documents and the circumstances, but the process usually
              involves the following:
            </p>
            <ul className="points-list" style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }}>
              {disputeSteps.map((item) => (
                <li key={item}>{item}</li>
              ))}
            </ul>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "1.25rem" }}>
              Where a property contract or lease requires the parties to attempt negotiation or mediation
              first, following that process matters. It can also produce a resolution at far less cost than
              a hearing, particularly where both parties want the transaction or tenancy to continue.

            <h2>Why Acting Early Matters</h2>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink)", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
              Property matters are governed by dates. Settlement dates, notice periods and the time allowed
              to satisfy a condition all pass quickly, and steps that are available now may not be
              available later. Correspondence sent without advice can also affect your position, especially
              where it contains a concession or fails to raise a defence.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              Where a dispute concerns a property notice you have received, the notice should be reviewed
              before you respond. Where a dispute concerns a lease, the lease terms and any notices
              exchanged determine what can be done.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              We can also assist with the related areas of property contract review, lease advice and
              property notices.
