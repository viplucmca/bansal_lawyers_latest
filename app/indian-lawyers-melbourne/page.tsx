  {
    question: "Can I divorce in Australia if I married in India?",
    answer:
      "Yes, if the marriage is recognised and an Australian court has jurisdiction. A marriage that was valid in India is generally recognised here. You can apply after 12 months of separation. At least one spouse must be an Australian citizen, domiciled in Australia, or ordinarily resident in Australia for the 12 months before filing. The divorce ends the marriage only. Parenting arrangements and property settlement are separate.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my property in India included in an Australian property settlement?",
    answer:
      "It can be. When the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia decides a property settlement, it looks at the property of both parties, including assets outside Australia. A house, land or business interest in India can be taken into account. The order binds the spouses. It does not, by itself, change the title records in India. A transfer or sale there can still require steps under Indian law.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I resolve a dispute with my business partner?",
    answer:
      "Start with the agreement and the accounts. A partnership agreement, a shareholders agreement, the company register and the payment records show who owns the business and what was promised. Many disputes settle by negotiation or a buy-out once those facts are on the table. If they do not, the next step may be a letter of demand, mediation, or a claim in VCAT or a court, depending on the amount and the type of dispute. Get advice before you move money out of the business or resign as a director.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a separate will for my assets in India?",
    answer:
      "Often, yes, if you own land or other immovable property in India. That property is governed by the law of the place where it sits. A will made only in Australia is not always the document an Indian registry, bank or court will act on, and a later Indian will can revoke the Australian will if the revocation clause is too wide. We draft the two so they work together. What you can leave in India also depends on the succession rules for your religion.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get advice in Hindi or Punjabi?",
    answer:
      "Yes. You can take advice in English, Hindi or Punjabi. That includes meetings at the Collins Street office and online consultations if you are elsewhere in Australia, or if family in India are joining the call. Court documents are still prepared in English.",
  },
  {
    question: "What documents should I bring to a consultation about a family business dispute?",
    answer:
      "Bring whatever you can find. That’s usually partnership or shareholder agreements, company records, bank and accounting statements, contracts, invoices, and any emails or messages with the other side. A rough timeline helps too. If something’s missing, come anyway and we’ll tell you what to look for.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I consult Bansal Lawyers if I live outside Melbourne?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We act for clients across Australia by phone or secure video, and we also advise overseas clients on Australian law. If you’d prefer to meet in person, you’re welcome at our Collins Street office. Just tell us which you’d like when you book.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can family members in India participate in an online legal consultation?",
    answer:
      "Yes. They can join by phone or video from wherever they are. What you tell us is confidential, so we’ll check who’s on the call before we discuss your matter. Tell us when you book who’ll be joining and we’ll set it up.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you act in criminal matters?",
    answer:
      "Yes. If you’re looking for Indian criminal lawyers in Melbourne, our criminal lawyers act for people facing criminal charges, traffic offences and police matters. That includes bail applications and breaches of intervention orders. If you’ve got a court date or the police have contacted you, call us early.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between a will and a power of attorney?",
    answer:
      "A will takes effect after you die. A power of attorney works while you’re alive. In Victoria, an enduring power of attorney lets someone make financial and personal decisions for you, even if you later lose capacity. If you own assets in two countries, you may need more than one document. Our wills lawyers can go through what suits you.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do my documents need to be translated into English?",
    answer:
      "If a document is in Hindi or Punjabi and will be used in court, it generally needs an English translation from a certified translator. Bring the originals to your first meeting and we’ll tell you which ones need translating, so you don’t pay for translations you won’t use.",

              Many clients married in India, own a flat or land there, or run a company with parents, siblings or cousins. Australian law answers some of those questions. Indian law answers others.

          <h2>Divorce, Parenting and Property After an Indian Marriage</h2>
          <p style={{ fontSize: "1.08rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink)", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
            A marriage celebrated in India can be ended in an Australian court when the Family Law Act applies. One spouse must be an Australian citizen, domiciled in Australia, or ordinarily resident here for the 12 months before the application. The couple must have been separated for 12 months. That period can include time under the same roof, if the separation is real. The divorce order ends the marriage. It does not divide property or decide where children live.
          </p>
          <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
            Parenting arrangements are decided by what is in the child&apos;s best interests. Most parents must try family dispute resolution before they ask the court for parenting orders, unless the matter is urgent or there is family violence. We help with those arrangements, with negotiations, and with consent orders when you reach an agreement.
          </p>
          <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
            Property settlement looks at what both spouses own, including assets outside Australia. A house, a plot or an interest in a family business in India can be part of the pool. An order made in Australia binds the spouses. Registering a transfer on an Indian title is a further step, and it follows the local registry. Spousal maintenance, for a former partner who cannot meet their own reasonable needs, is not paid in every case. Married couples generally have 12 months from the date the divorce order takes effect to apply for property orders or spousal maintenance. De facto couples generally have two years from the end of the relationship.
          </p>
          <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
            Family violence orders in Victoria are intervention orders under the Family Violence Protection Act 2008, usually heard in the Magistrates&apos; Court. If you are in immediate danger, call 000. We act for people applying for an order and for people responding to one, including where parenting or property are running at the same time.

          <p style={{ fontSize: "1.08rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink)", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
            Many Indian family businesses in Melbourne are partnerships or private companies. The shares or the partnership interests sit with parents, siblings or cousins. The dispute often starts at home and becomes a legal problem when drawings stop, one person wants to leave, or a lease or franchise agreement is in one relative&apos;s name only.

          <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
            We help with partnership and shareholder disputes, including deadlocks, arguments about ownership, and exits where there is no written agreement or the agreement does not match how the business was run. Franchise disputes and shop-lease disputes often sit in the same file. We read the agreement, the company records and the payments, then write to the other side, negotiate a buy-out, or advise on a claim.

          <p style={{ fontSize: "1.08rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink)", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
            Commercial disputes are the contract and payment problems around those businesses. An invoice is unpaid. A supplier did not deliver. A customer refuses a progress claim. A relative who was also a customer says the deal was different from the written terms.
          </p>
          <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
            We help with contract disputes, debt recovery and letters of demand, whether you are owed the money or you have received a demand. A letter of demand states what is owed, why, and the date for payment. It is often the step before a claim. Some smaller disputes are heard at VCAT. Larger contract claims, and many company disputes, are issued in a court. Which path fits depends on the amount, the contract and the type of claim. Bring the contract, the invoices and the messages to the first meeting.

          <p style={{ fontSize: "1.08rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink)", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
            A will says what happens to your property when you die. If you hold assets in Australia and in India, one document is not always enough. Land in India is dealt with under the law of the place where that property is, and a registry, bank or court there may expect a will that meets Indian formalities. Many clients need an Australian will and an Indian will, written so that one does not revoke the other. Succession rules in India also differ by religion, so the same draft does not suit every family.
          </p>
          <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
            A power of attorney is a different document. A will operates after death. A power of attorney operates while you are alive. In Victoria, an enduring power of attorney appoints someone to make financial and personal decisions, including if you later lose capacity. A medical treatment decision maker is appointed separately for health decisions. If a relative in India needs to sell, lease or manage property for you, that is usually an{" "}

          <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
            If a will is challenged, or a family member was left out, the Victorian claim is generally a family provision application under the Administration and Probate Act 1958. Eligible people can ask the court for further provision. The usual time limit is six months from the grant of probate, so a challenge should not wait.

          <h2>How to Prepare for Your First Legal Consultation</h2>
          <p style={{ fontSize: "1.08rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink)", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
            A little preparation helps you get more out of the first meeting. You don&apos;t need to have it all sorted. These steps will help.
          </p>
          <h3 style={{ marginTop: "1.75rem", fontSize: "1.25rem" }}>1. Identify Your Legal Issue</h3>
          <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
            Start with a rough idea of the problem. Is it a divorce, a business dispute, a property issue, a will or a criminal charge? Pick whichever is closest. If you&apos;re not sure, just tell us what happened and we&apos;ll work out where it fits.
          </p>
          <h3 style={{ marginTop: "1.75rem", fontSize: "1.25rem" }}>2. Gather Your Documents</h3>
          <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
            What you&apos;ll need depends on the matter. A divorce calls for different papers than a business dispute. Common ones are:
          </p>
          <ul style={{ marginTop: "0.75rem", paddingLeft: "1.25rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)" }}>
            <li>Marriage certificate and ID</li>
            <li>Court, police or tribunal papers</li>
            <li>Property records and loan statements</li>
            <li>Contracts, company records and messages</li>
            <li>Any existing will</li>
          </ul>
          <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
            Can&apos;t find everything? Bring what you&apos;ve got and we&apos;ll tell you what else is needed.
          </p>
          <h3 style={{ marginTop: "1.75rem", fontSize: "1.25rem" }}>3. Prepare a Timeline</h3>
          <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
            Jot down the key dates: when you married or separated, when the dispute began, and any earlier court steps. If you have a court date or a letter with a deadline, let us know as soon as you can. Some time limits are short.
          </p>
          <h3 style={{ marginTop: "1.75rem", fontSize: "1.25rem" }}>4. List Your Questions</h3>
          <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
            Most people want to know their options, what happens next, how long it could take and what it might cost. Write your questions down so you don&apos;t forget them once you&apos;re in the meeting.
          </p>
          <h3 style={{ marginTop: "1.75rem", fontSize: "1.25rem" }}>5. Discuss the Next Steps</h3>
          <hr className="ajay-profile-divider" />
          <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
            We may need to read through your documents before we can advise on your options. We can&apos;t promise an outcome, a timeframe or a fee until we&apos;ve looked at your matter.
