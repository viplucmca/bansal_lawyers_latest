  {
    question: "What is the difference between careless driving and dangerous driving?",
    answer:
      "Careless driving (Section 65 of the Road Safety Act 1986) involves driving without due care and attention, falling below the standard of a reasonable and prudent driver. Dangerous driving (Section 64) is a significantly more serious offence requiring the prosecution to prove that the driving was at a speed or in a manner that was dangerous to the public having regard to all circumstances. Dangerous driving carries mandatory minimum licence cancellation periods and potential imprisonment.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I am caught driving while suspended or disqualified in Victoria?",
    answer:
      "Driving while disqualified or suspended is viewed very seriously by Victorian courts under Section 30 of the Road Safety Act 1986. For repeat offences, the court may impose heavy fines, extended licence disqualification periods, vehicle immobilisation or impoundment, and even term of imprisonment. Early legal advice is crucial to mitigate penalties.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can the court grant a 'work licence' or probationary permit in Victoria?",
    answer:
      "No. Unlike some other Australian states, Victoria does not have hardship licences, work licences, or conditional permits. If a mandatory licence cancellation or suspension period applies under Victorian legislation, neither the magistrate nor VicRoads has the legal discretion to grant an exemption for employment or medical reasons. This makes it vital to explore whether charges can be defended or negotiated before penalties are imposed.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the rules regarding excessive speeding in Victoria?",
    answer:
      "In Victoria, exceeding the speed limit by 25 km/h or more (or driving at 130 km/h or more regardless of the limit) triggers mandatory licence suspension under the Road Safety Act. The suspension periods range from 3 months to 12 months or longer depending on how far above the limit the vehicle was travelling. In addition, immediate notices of suspension can be issued roadside by Victoria Police.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do demerit points work if I receive a notice of suspension from VicRoads?",
    answer:
      "If you accumulate 12 or more demerit points within a 3-year period (or 5 points for probationary drivers), VicRoads will issue a Notice of Demerit Point Suspension. You generally have the option to accept the suspension or elect the '12-month good behaviour bond' (golden point). If you incur any demerit points during the 12-month period, your licence will be suspended for double the original term.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can a traffic offence result in a criminal record?",
    answer:
      "Yes. While routine traffic infringements paid via penalty notice do not result in a criminal record, traffic charges that proceed to the Magistrates' Court—such as dangerous driving, driving disqualified, or reckless driving—can result in a formal criminal conviction being recorded unless the magistrate exercises discretion to impose a non-conviction disposition.",

            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.08rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink)", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
              Traffic law in Victoria is governed by the Road Safety Act 1986 and associated road safety
              regulations. Victorian traffic legislation contains some of the strictest penalties in Australia,
              including mandatory minimum licence cancellation periods, substantial fines, vehicle impoundment,
              and potential custodial sentences for serious driving conduct.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              Because Victoria does not offer hardship or work licences, losing your licence means an absolute
              prohibition on driving. Whether you are confronting charges of careless driving, driving while
              suspended, or excessive speeding, early legal advice is essential to determine whether the charge
              can be contested or if mitigating factors can reduce penalties.
