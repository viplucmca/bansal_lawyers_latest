  {
    question: "What are the legal BAC limits in Victoria?",
    answer:
      "For fully licenced Victorian drivers, the legal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limit is under 0.05. However, a strict zero BAC (0.00) requirement applies to learner drivers, probationary drivers (P1 and P2), heavy vehicle drivers, bus and commercial passenger vehicle drivers, and those with an interlock condition on their licence.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can the court waive the licence suspension for drink driving in Victoria?",
    answer:
      "No. Under Victorian legislation (Section 50 of the Road Safety Act 1986), minimum licence cancellation periods are strictly mandatory. If you are found guilty or plead guilty to exceeding the prescribed concentration of alcohol, the magistrate has no legal discretion to reduce the disqualification period below the statutory minimum, even if you will lose your job.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is an alcohol interlock condition?",
    answer:
      "An alcohol interlock is an electronic breath-testing device wired to a vehicle's ignition system that prevents the vehicle from starting if alcohol is detected. In Victoria, almost all drink driving convictions require an interlock condition to be placed on the driver licence for a minimum period (often 6 months to several years) upon licence restoration.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the penalty for refusing a breath test in Victoria?",
    answer:
      "Refusing or failing to provide a breath or blood sample without a valid medical reason is treated as severely as a high-range drink driving offence. Under Section 49(1)(e) of the Road Safety Act 1986, refusal carries a mandatory minimum licence cancellation of at least 2 years for a first offence (and 4 years for a repeat offence), substantial fines, and potential imprisonment for repeat offenders.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can a drink driving charge be contested on technical grounds?",
    answer:
      "Yes, in certain circumstances. Technical defences may arise if police failed to conduct the evidentiary breath test within 3 hours of the alleged driving, if police did not provide the required statutory cautions, if the breath analysis machine had not been properly calibrated, or if post-accident alcohol consumption occurred before the test.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will a drink driving conviction appear on my criminal record?",
    answer:
      "Yes. If your drink driving charge proceeds to court and a magistrate records a conviction, it will appear on your Victorian and National Police Certificate as a criminal traffic conviction. However, an experienced lawyer can make submissions urging the court to find the charge proven without recording a conviction where the law permits.",

              Drink driving laws in Victoria are governed by the Road Safety Act 1986 and are among the most
              strictly enforced in Australia. Offences involving driving under the influence (DUI) or exceeding
              the prescribed concentration of alcohol carry mandatory licence cancellations, interlock device
              conditions, and significant financial penalties.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              Because Victorian magistrates cannot grant work licences or special hardship exemptions,
              understanding your exact legal rights and examining the technical validity of the police breath
              test is critical. Where charges cannot be contested, thorough preparation for your court hearing
              is vital to ensure that minimum mandatory terms are not extended and mitigating circumstances are
              clearly presented.

            Outcomes in drink driving matters depend on the recorded alcohol reading, whether an accident
            occurred, prior traffic record, and the specific procedures followed by police during testing.

              For many clients, a loss of licence puts their employment directly at risk. While Victorian
