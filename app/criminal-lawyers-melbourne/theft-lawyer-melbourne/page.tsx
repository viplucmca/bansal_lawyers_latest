  {
    question: "What constitutes theft under Victorian criminal law?",
    answer:
      "Under Section 72 of the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic), a person steals if they dishonestly appropriate property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it. To secure a conviction, the prosecution must establish all three core elements beyond reasonable doubt: appropriation, dishonesty, and the intention to permanently deprive.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is an 'honest claim of right' in a theft matter?",
    answer:
      "Under Victorian law, a person is not deemed dishonest if they appropriated property believing that they had the legal right to deprive the other of it, or believing they would have the owner's consent if the owner knew of the circumstances. An honest belief in a legal entitlement, even if mistaken, can form a valid legal defence against a charge of theft.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I avoid a criminal conviction for a first-time theft charge?",
    answer:
      "For first-time or minor theft allegations, an accused person may be eligible for the Magistrates' Court Criminal Diversion Program. If the police prosecutor consents and the presiding magistrate approves the application, the matter can be resolved through specific conditions (such as a donation, apology, or good behaviour bond) without a criminal conviction being recorded.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does an employee theft allegation differ from standard theft?",
    answer:
      "Workplace theft or theft by an employee is often treated more seriously by the courts because it involves a breach of trust between employer and employee. Such cases frequently involve detailed accounting records, inventory audits, and digital surveillance. Obtaining early legal advice before answering workplace queries or attending police interviews is critical.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will a theft conviction affect my employment or background checks?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Dishonesty offences such as theft can severely impact current and prospective employment, particularly in banking, accounting, retail management, legal services, and positions requiring security clearances or Working with Children Checks. It can also create barriers for overseas travel visas and immigration citizenship applications.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should I speak to police if they call me in for a theft interview?",
    answer:
      "You should contact a criminal defence lawyer before speaking to Victoria Police or attending the station. You are legally required to confirm your name and address, but you are not obligated to answer questions regarding the alleged theft. Seeking advice early ensures you do not inadvertently make statements that harm your defence.",

              Theft allegations in Melbourne encompass a broad spectrum of circumstances, from retail shop
              theft and property disputes to complex employee misappropriation and commercial stock losses.
              Regardless of the scale, any dishonesty allegation requires careful legal analysis to ensure your
              rights are protected from the outset.

            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              The legal definition of theft requires the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the
              appropriation was dishonest and accompanied by an intention to permanently deprive the owner.
              Examining the factual background, intent, and evidentiary records is vital to determining the
              proper legal strategy.
