                  Yes! You can represent yourself during the review process.
                  However, if you prefer to have a professional on your side, we
                  are here to help. You can appoint a registered migration agent
                  or an Australian lawyer to represent you. They will act on your
                  behalf, ensuring that everything is done correctly and

                  We understand that cost is an important factor, and we want to
                  ensure that you have access to the support you need. The fee
                  for most migration visa reviews is $3,727 from 1 July 2026. However, if you are
                  dealing with specific issues like immigration detention or
                  certain visa types, there might be no application fee.
