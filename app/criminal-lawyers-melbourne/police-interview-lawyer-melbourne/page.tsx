  {
    question: "Do I have to answer police questions during a criminal interview in Victoria?",
    answer:
      "No. Under Victorian law, you have a fundamental right to silence. Aside from being legally required to provide your full name and residential address, you are under no obligation to answer questions regarding alleged offences. You can politely answer 'no comment' to all questions about the allegations.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will answering 'no comment' make me look guilty to police or the court?",
    answer:
      "No. Under Victorian law (Section 464J of the Crimes Act 1958 and the Evidence Act 2008), an accused person has an absolute right to remain silent. The prosecution and judge cannot invite a jury or magistrate to infer guilt simply because you exercised your legal right not to answer questions during a police interview.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I bring a lawyer with me to a police interview?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Under Section 464C of the Crimes Act 1958, an investigating police officer must, before questioning or conducting an investigation, inform you that you may communicate with a legal practitioner and give you reasonable facilities to do so. A lawyer can advise you beforehand and, where appropriate, attend the interview.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if police ask for my phone passcode?",
    answer:
      "Under Victorian law, you are generally not required to provide your phone passcode or unlock your device unless police have obtained a specific judicial 'data access order' or search warrant order issued by a magistrate under Section 465AAA of the Crimes Act 1958. Handing over your phone voluntarily can provide police with unrestricted access to personal messages, photographs, and location history.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can an informal conversation with police be used against me?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Any statement, remark, or admission made to a police officer—even in the police car, in the station reception, or during casual conversation before the recording starts—can be written down by the officer in their official notebook and tendered as evidence in court. It is essential not to discuss the allegations informally.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should I do if police contact me asking for an interview?",
    answer:
      "Politely request the officer's name, station, contact number, and the nature of the matter they wish to discuss. State that you intend to seek legal advice first and that your lawyer will contact them. Then contact our criminal defence team immediately before speaking further with the officer.",

            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.08rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink)", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
              When Victoria Police contact an individual requesting an interview, it is rarely a casual enquiry.
              In almost all instances, investigators already suspect that an offence has been committed and are
              seeking admissions, corroborating details, or inconsistencies to build a stronger prosecution brief.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              Many people mistakenly believe that by attending an interview and &ldquo;explaining their side of the
              story,&rdquo; police will see reason and drop the investigation. In reality, statements made in
              unprepared interviews are frequently the single piece of evidence that secures a conviction.
              Obtaining independent legal counsel before answering questions is your most powerful safeguard.

              We communicate directly with the investigating officer on your behalf to arrange a structured

              Police officers are skilled investigators trained in questioning techniques designed to elicit
              admissions. Even statements intended to be entirely innocent can confirm that you were at the scene,
              confirm ownership of property, or reveal inconsistencies that prosecutors will later use against you.

              By seeking legal advice beforehand, you level the playing field. We clarify exactly what powers
              police have, what they cannot compel you to do, and how to maintain a calm, legally protected
              position throughout the process.
