            <p>
              <strong>Judicial review</strong> is a challenge in the Federal
              Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2) or the Federal
              Court of Australia to a migration decision on the ground of{" "}
              <strong>jurisdictional error</strong>. It is not a re-hearing of
              the merits. The court examines whether the decision-maker acted
              lawfully.
            </p>
            <p style={{ marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              Common grounds include failure to consider a mandatory relevant
              consideration, denial of procedural fairness, legal
              unreasonableness, or asking the wrong question. If successful, the
              court usually quashes the decision and remits it for
              reconsideration. The court does not grant the visa itself.
