  {
    question: "What is civil litigation in Victoria?",
    answer:
      "Civil litigation is the legal process of resolving non-criminal disputes through the court or tribunal system. It typically involves one party (the plaintiff or applicant) seeking a legal remedy—such as financial damages, specific performance, or an injunction—against another party (the defendant or respondent) for a breach of contract, unpaid debt, property issue, or other civil wrong.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why should litigation be considered a last resort?",
    answer:
      "Civil litigation involves significant financial costs, management distraction, emotional stress, and strict court timetables. Furthermore, Victorian courts under the Civil Procedure Act 2010 mandate that parties must attempt genuine dispute resolution before entering trial. Litigation is generally pursued when negotiated settlements or mediation fail to deliver a reasonable outcome.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do legal costs work in Victorian civil litigation?",
    answer:
      "In Victorian courts, the general rule is that 'costs follow the event'—meaning the unsuccessful party is usually ordered to pay a portion of the successful party's legal costs (typically on an ordinary basis, which covers approximately 60% to 75% of actual costs). In VCAT, however, the default starting rule is that each party bears their own costs, subject to specific statutory exceptions.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the timeframes for a civil court case in Melbourne?",
    answer:
      "Timeframes vary depending on the jurisdiction and complexity. VCAT matters can take anywhere from a few months to over a year. Magistrates' Court civil claims often take 6 to 12 months to reach a hearing. County Court and Supreme Court litigation typically takes 12 to 24 months, encompassing pleadings, discovery, mediation, and trial preparation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can a case be settled after court proceedings have already started?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Most litigated cases settle before trial, often during court-ordered mediation or after the exchange of witness evidence. Settlements reached during litigation are formally recorded in Consent Orders or Deeds of Settlement and Release, discontinuing the court action and avoiding the uncertainty of a judicial ruling.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the Overarching Obligations requirement under Victorian civil law?",
    answer:
      "Under the Civil Procedure Act 2010 (Vic), litigants and lawyers owe overarching statutory duties to the court. These include obligations to act honestly, maintain claims with a proper basis, narrow the issues in dispute, cooperate, and take reasonable steps to resolve the matter early to minimise delay and costs.",
