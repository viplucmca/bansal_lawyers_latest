  {
    question: "What is the difference between unlawful assault and causing injury in Victoria?",
    answer:
      "Under Victorian law, unlawful assault (often heard under the Summary Offences Act) involves the application or threat of force without lawful justification, even if no physical injury occurs. More serious offences, such as recklessly causing injury or intentionally causing injury under the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic), carry significantly higher maximum penalties and require the prosecution to prove that actual bodily or psychological harm was sustained.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should I attend a police interview for an assault allegation without legal advice?",
    answer:
      "No. Anything you say in a formal police record of interview can be used as prosecution evidence in court. You have a fundamental common law and statutory right to silence, aside from providing your name, address, and identification details. Consulting an assault lawyer prior to attending the police station helps ensure your rights are protected and prevents unintended self-incrimination.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can an assault charge impact my employment and ability to travel?",
    answer:
      "Yes. An assault conviction recorded on a National Police Certificate can have serious consequences for employment, particularly in regulated professions, security, healthcare, and education. It can also restrict overseas travel visas and affect Working with Children Checks or professional licences. The exact outcome depends on whether a conviction is formally recorded by the court.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if an assault charge is connected to an intervention order?",
    answer:
      "If the alleged incident involves a family member, partner, or person protected by an Intervention Order (IVO), Victoria Police may initiate both criminal assault charges and criminal breach of intervention order proceedings. These matters often run concurrently in the Magistrates' Court and require coordinated defence strategies across both criminal and family law frameworks.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can an assault charge be withdrawn or resolved without a trial?",
    answer:
      "In certain circumstances, prosecution negotiations (case conferencing) may lead to charges being withdrawn, substituted with less serious summary offences, or recommended for the Criminal Diversion Program if eligibility criteria are met. Whether this is viable depends on the strength of the evidence, witness credibility, prior criminal history, and the specific facts of the allegation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which court hears assault cases in Melbourne?",
    answer:
      "Most assault offences, including unlawful assault and reckless injury matters, are determined summarily in the Magistrates' Court of Victoria (such as Melbourne, Moorabbin, Broadmeadows, Ringwood, or Dandenong). More serious indictable charges, such as intentionally causing serious injury, may be committed to the County Court of Victoria.",

              Assault charges in Victoria range from summary unlawful assault matters arising from verbal
              altercations or minor physical contact to serious indictable offences involving grievous bodily
              harm. When police initiate charges, the immediate priority is to examine the allegations, evaluate
              the evidence objectively, and establish an informed defence strategy.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              The outcome of an assault matter can carry lasting consequences. A recorded conviction can impact
              your current employment, professional accreditation, international travel visas, and family
              relationships. Every matter depends on its unique facts, documentary records, witness credibility,
              statutory defences, and court procedures.

              When facing assault allegations in Victoria, taking decisive, measured action is essential. Whether

              preparation makes an immense difference.
