  {
    question: "What is deemed 'possession' of a drug in Victoria?",
    answer:
      "Under Victorian law, possession requires both physical custody or control over the substance and knowledge that the illicit item is present. Section 5 of the Drugs, Poisons and Controlled Substances Act 1981 creates a legal presumption that drugs found on premises occupied by a person are in their possession, unless the person proves they did not know the drug was there. Rebutting this presumption requires precise evidentiary analysis.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between drug possession and drug trafficking?",
    answer:
      "Drug possession involves having an illicit substance for personal use without commercial intent. Drug trafficking involves selling, offering for sale, preparing, moving, or manufacturing drugs. In Victoria, possessing a quantity above the statutory 'trafficable quantity' threshold creates a legal presumption that you possessed the substance for the purpose of trafficking, placing the legal burden on the defence to prove personal use.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can police search my person, bag, or car without a warrant?",
    answer:
      "Under Section 82 of the Drugs, Poisons and Controlled Substances Act 1981 (Vic), Victoria Police officers may search a person, vehicle, or vessel without a warrant if they have reasonable grounds to suspect that a drug of dependence is present. If police lacked reasonable grounds, the evidence gathered during the search may be ruled inadmissible under Section 138 of the Evidence Act 2008.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get diversion for a first-time drug possession charge in Melbourne?",
    answer:
      "Yes. First-time offenders charged with minor drug possession (such as personal amounts of cannabis, cocaine, or MDMA) may be eligible for the Magistrates' Court Criminal Diversion Program. If granted, the accused person completes conditions (such as drug education and good behaviour) and no conviction or criminal finding is recorded.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will a drug charge affect my visa, citizenship, or international travel?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Australia's Department of Home Affairs scrutinises drug offences under the Migration Act character test, which can lead to visa refusals or cancellations. In addition, many foreign countries (including the United States, Canada, and Japan) strictly deny entry or require special visa waivers for individuals with drug convictions.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is it difficult to get bail for drug trafficking charges?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Under the Victorian Bail Act 1977, serious drug charges—particularly trafficking commercial quantities—place the accused in a reverse-onus position where they must prove 'exceptional circumstances' or 'compelling reason' why their detention in custody is not justified. Thorough preparation of bail conditions and supporting guarantees is critical.",

            <h2>Comprehensive Legal Defence for Drug Offences in Victoria</h2>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.08rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink)", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
              Drug offences in Victoria are governed by the Drugs, Poisons and Controlled Substances Act 1981,
              encompassing allegations ranging from simple possession for personal use to commercial trafficking
              and cultivation. Whether you have been charged after a roadside vehicle search, a nightclub
              inspection, or a formal police search warrant, obtaining independent legal advice promptly is
              crucial.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              A key consideration in drug matters is examining how the evidence was obtained. If police conducted
              an unlawful stop-and-search without reasonable grounds or breached search warrant parameters,
              that evidence can be challenged in court. Furthermore, establishing the true quantity, purity,
              and purpose of possession can dramatically affect the legal threshold and available penalties.

              A recorded drug conviction can have severe ripple effects on your future. It can trigger mandatory
