  {
    question: "What is the difference between a civil intervention order and a criminal family violence charge?",
    answer:
      "A Family Violence Intervention Order (FVIO) is a civil court order made under the Family Violence Protection Act 2008 to protect an individual from family violence. While making an IVO does not give the respondent a criminal record, breaching any condition of that order is a criminal offence. In many situations, Victoria Police initiate both civil IVO proceedings and separate criminal charges (such as assault or property damage) arising from the same incident.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do family violence charges affect bail applications in Victoria?",
    answer:
      "Under the Victorian Bail Act 1977, family violence allegations trigger heightened statutory scrutiny. In many family violence matters, an accused person is in a 'show compelling reason' or 'exceptional circumstances' category, requiring them to demonstrate to the court why detention is not justified, and that any risk to the protected person can be sufficiently managed through strict conditions.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can an intervention order condition prevent me from seeing my children?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Standard intervention order conditions prohibit an accused person from contacting the protected person directly or indirectly, which can unintentionally prevent contact with children if they live with the protected parent. However, orders can be tailored or varied to permit contact that is in accordance with Family Court parenting orders or written parenting agreements.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the penalty for breaching a family violence intervention order in Victoria?",
    answer:
      "Under Section 123 of the Family Violence Protection Act 2008, contravening an intervention order carries a maximum penalty of 2 years imprisonment or a significant fine. If the breach involves intention to cause harm or fear, or constitutes persistent contravention under Section 125A, maximum penalties increase to 5 years imprisonment.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can the complainant 'drop' the family violence charges?",
    answer:
      "No. In Victoria, criminal charges are brought by the State (Victoria Police), not by the individual complainant. Even if the affected family member provides a statement indicating they wish the charges to be withdrawn, police prosecutors maintain independent discretion to proceed with the prosecution based on other evidence (such as 000 calls, body-worn camera footage, or admissions).",
  },
  {
    question: "How do family violence criminal charges impact visa status in Australia?",
    answer:
      "The Department of Home Affairs takes family violence offences extremely seriously. Under Section 501 of the Migration Act 1958, non-citizens facing family violence convictions or custodial sentences face mandatory visa cancellation or refusal under the character test. Seeking urgent legal advice is vital for non-citizens.",

            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.08rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink)", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
              In Victoria, allegations of family violence are handled with zero-tolerance policies by Victoria
              Police. When an incident occurs, police often take immediate action by issuing a Family Violence
              Safety Notice, initiating criminal assault or property damage charges, and applying for an interim
              Intervention Order.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: "1.75", color: "var(--ink-secondary)", marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
              These matters frequently arise in the emotionally charged environment of relationship breakdown,
              parenting disputes, or financial stress. It is crucial to have legal counsel that understands both
              the strict procedural rules of the criminal courts and the nuanced dynamics of family law.
            </p>
